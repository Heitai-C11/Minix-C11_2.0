This fix avoids a crash of the TCP/IP server if it is sent a huge "ping"
packet.  This only works for Minix in 32-bit mode, because we simply
increase the number of buffers inside inet to allow it to handle a big
packet.  16-bit Minix can't have more buffers.

To apply this fix do the following as bin:

	! cd /usr
	! patch -p0 < "this-file"

And build a new kernel normally.  You will find the original buf.c
file renamed to buf.c~ in src/inet/.  You may wish to delete it
to clean things up.

Note that it is much quicker and easier to simple change "128" in "192"
in buf.c with an editor.
