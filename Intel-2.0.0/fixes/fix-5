This fix repairs a bug in the interpretation of the "MCD" boot variable.
Right now it simply doesn't work, so the Mitsumi driver is locked to
I/O 300, IRQ 10.  (Note that this is a driver for the old and obsolete
proprietary Mitsumi interface.  Newer Mitsumi devices are IDE, so don't
go to the trouble to patch mcd.c to find out that it won't work anyway.)

To apply this fix do the following as bin:

	! cd /usr
	! patch -p0 < "this-file"

And build a new kernel normally.  You will find the original mcd.c file
renamed to mcd.c~ in src/kernel/.  You may wish to delete it to clean
things up.
