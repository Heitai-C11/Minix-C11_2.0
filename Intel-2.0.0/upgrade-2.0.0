How to upgrade from 1.7.4 (or 1.7.5) to 2.0.0.

Note: Things you have to do as root are marked with a # sign.  The ! sign
marks the actions of bin.

# Replace the sources, that's /usr/include, /usr/man, and /usr/src, with
  the 2.0.0 sources by extracting the SYS.nn images in the normal way.
  (Don't forget to move or remove the 1.7.4 stuff.)

! Move to /usr/src/lib and type 'make install'.  You need new libraries
  for the new kernel.

! Customize /usr/include/minix/config.h to add or remove drivers.  In
  /usr/src/tools type 'make hdboot'.  Reboot.

! Your system should now be running 2.0.0.  Install the commands from CMD.nn
  and use 'make install' in /usr/src to recompile the rest of the system.

# Run 'checkhier' to check your top level directory tree.  It suggest
  commands to execute to fix descrepancies in the top level directory
  tree.

# Compare all files in /usr/src/etc with those in /etc.  Some may have
  changed and should be replaced.  Be careful not to lose changes you
  have made to files in /etc.
