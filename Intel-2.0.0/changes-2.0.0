Short list of differences between 1.7.4 and 2.0.0:

  - Lots of manual pages replaced or added to describe the system and
    library calls better (manual sections 2, and 3).

  - Little bug fixes so that the CD-ROM doesn't look too bad.  :-)

Long list of differences between 1.7.4 and 2.0.0:

  (Warning: This list is riddled with lame jokes and other silly things that
  happen to sneak in when doing something as boring as compiling this list.)

  man/cat[23]/
  	Removed in favour of real manual pages in man[23].

  man/man0/
  	Most of these manual pages are transformed to normal man(7) style
  	and put into section 1 or 8.  Leftovers are put in section 9.

  man/man*/
  	Lots of old BSD4.3 manual pages checked and changed for use under
  	Minix.

  ./src/boot/boot.c
  	Bug fixed where the menu hangs if you type an odd key like an
  	arrow key.

  ./src/commands/ash/
	Files echo.o, errmsg.c, errmsg.h, and expr.o removed.  They were
	sitting there doing nothing.
	Type warnings fixed.

  ./src/commands/cawf/dumb.dev
  	Paper size changed from 11 inch (66 lines) to 10 inch (60 lines),
  	because they don't make good printers anymore.

  ./src/commands/cawf/man.mac
  	\*(lq and \*(rq added for left and right double quote.

  ./src/commands/flex-2.3.7/
  	Warnings on flex.l suppressed.

  ./src/commands/ftp/
  ./src/commands/ftpd/
  	Updated to Michael's latest code.

  ./src/commands/ibm/part.c
  	More changes in the ongoing attempt to make part a wee bit
  	user-friendlier.

  ./src/commands/ibm/postmort.c
  	Changes from Will Rose to "increase its functionality".

  ./src/commands/scripts/DESCRIBE.sh
  ./src/commands/scripts/MAKEDEV.sh
  	Allow 7 virtual console devices to be made/described.

  ./src/commands/scripts/checkhier.sh
  	Add /usr/spool/lpd, remove lpr, check lpd, kludge around a shell
  	memory leak.

  ./src/commands/scripts/makewhatis.sh
  	Don't look into cat pages anymore, only do man[1-8] and man9.

  ./src/commands/scripts/mkdist.sh
  	Add more command to USR, install /etc/issue on ROOT that tells you
  	to login as root and run 'setup'.

  ./src/commands/scripts/setup.sh
  	Upgrade capability removed, too confusing for a first time user
  	that wants to retry the installation.  Some bits of text adapted.
  	Change /etc/issue on first run, remove on second run.

  ./src/commands/simple/expr.c
  	Two fencepost errors fixed.  Amazing it ever did the things I like
  	to do with it.

  ./src/commands/simple/in.rshd.c
  	Set PATH=:/bin:/usr/bin for the command to run.  "Read failed", and
  	"killing %d with %d" messages removed.

  ./src/commands/simple/leave.c
  	Carriage returns added to the messages to put them on the screen
  	better.

  ./src/commands/simple/lp.c
  ./src/commands/simple/lpd.c
  	Replacements for lpr that do spooling.

  ./src/commands/simple/lpr.c
  	Removed.

  ./src/commands/simple/man.c
  	Search path changed from sections 0-8 to 1-9, where 9 now contains
  	"book style" manual pages.  Too early exit bug fixed.

  ./src/commands/simple/synctree.c
  	Problems on a sync between a systems with and without symlinks
  	fixed by properly complaining about the weird file and continuing on.

  ./src/commands/simple/tar.c
  	Error messages changed from things like "Can't make directory bin"
  	to "Can't make directory bin: File exists".

  ./src/commands/simple/tcpd.c
  	Added comment that -DPARANOID requires 8kw stack.

  ./src/commands/simple/term.c
  	Command added to hang up the phone (+++ ATH).

  ./src/commands/talk
  ./src/commands/talkd
  	New network commands by Michael.

  ./src/commands/yap/keys.c
  	Allow one to move up or down with the arrow keys.  (Yap == more).

  /etc/rc
  ./src/etc/rc

  	Start talkd if networking enabled.
  	Clean up /usr/spool/lpd/ and /usr/spool/locks/.

  ./src/kernel/keymaps/scandinavn.src
	New "Scandinavian" keymap.

  ./src/kernel/printer.c

  	runs out of paper.  Next write returns EAGAIN.

  ./src/kernel/pty.c
  ./src/kernel/tty.c
  ./src/kernel/tty.h
  ./src/kernel/type.h
  	Rearrangements by Al.

  ./src/lib/Makefile
  	Attempt to fix a library rebuild problem by properly removing any
  	leftover .o files on a 'make clean'.  The attempt failed, you
  	sometimes have to type 'make install' twice to get the library
  	to rebuild completely.

  ./src/lib/ansi/errlist.c
  	EAGAIN error string changed from "No more processes", to "Resource
  	temporarily unavailable."

  ./src/mm/table.c
  ./src/mm/trace.c
	Rearrangements by Al.

  ./src/test/
  	I changed something that may fix problems with leftover test
  	directories.  I have again resisted the temptation to remove
  	the tests entirely.  (The tests mostly test my patience.)
