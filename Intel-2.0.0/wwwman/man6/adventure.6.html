     The object of the game is to locate and explore Colossal Cave,  find  the
     treasures  hidden  there,  and  bring them back to the building with you.
     The program is self-descriptive to a point, but part of the  game  is  to
     discover its rules.

     To terminate a game, type `quit'; to save a game  for  later  resumption,
     type `save' now, and `restore' when you resume.
