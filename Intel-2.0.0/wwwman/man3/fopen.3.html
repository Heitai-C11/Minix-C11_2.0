<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Fopen</STRONG> opens the file named by <EM>filename</EM> and associates a stream  with  it.
     <STRONG>Fopen</STRONG>  returns  a pointer to be used to identify the stream in subsequent
     operations.

     <EM>Type</EM> is a character string having one of the following values:

     "r"  open for reading

     "w"  create for writing

     "a"  append: open for writing at end of file, or create for writing

     In addition, each <EM>type</EM> may be followed by a "+" to have the  file  opened
     for  reading  and writing.  "r+" positions the stream at the beginning of
     the file, "w+" creates or truncates it, and "a+" positions it at the end.
     Both  reads  and  writes  may  be  used  on  read/write streams, with the
     limitation that an <STRONG>fseek</STRONG>, <STRONG>rewind</STRONG>, or reading an end-of-file must be  used
     between a read and a write or vice-versa.

     <STRONG>Freopen</STRONG> substitutes the named file in  place  of  the  open  <EM>stream</EM>.   It
     returns the original value of <EM>stream</EM>.  The original stream is closed.

     <STRONG>Freopen</STRONG> is typically used to attach the preopened constant names,  <STRONG>stdin,</STRONG>
     <STRONG>stdout,</STRONG> <STRONG>stderr,</STRONG> to specified files.

     <STRONG>Fdopen</STRONG> associates a stream with a file  descriptor  obtained  from  <STRONG>open</STRONG>,
     <STRONG>dup</STRONG>,  <STRONG>creat</STRONG>, or <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/pipe.2.html">pipe(2)</A></STRONG>.  The <EM>type</EM> of the stream must agree with the mode
     of the open file.

</PRE>
<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Fopen</STRONG> and <STRONG>freopen</STRONG> return the pointer <STRONG>NULL</STRONG> if <EM>filename</EM> cannot be accessed,
     if  too  many files are already open, or if other resources needed cannot
     be allocated.




</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Fdopen</STRONG> is not portable to systems other than UNIX.

     The read/write <EM>types</EM> do not exist on all systems.  Those systems  without
     read/write  modes  will  probably  treat  the  <EM>type</EM> as if the "+" was not
     present.  These are unreliable in any event.
