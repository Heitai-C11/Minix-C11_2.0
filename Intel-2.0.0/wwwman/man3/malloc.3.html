<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Malloc</STRONG> and <STRONG>free</STRONG> provide  a  general-purpose  memory  allocation  package.
     <STRONG>Malloc</STRONG> returns a pointer to a block of at least <EM>size</EM> bytes beginning on a
     word boundary.

     The argument to <STRONG>free</STRONG> is a pointer to  a  block  previously  allocated  by
     <STRONG>malloc</STRONG>;  this  space  is  made  available for further allocation, but its
     contents are left undisturbed.  A call with a null <EM>ptr</EM> is legal and  does
     nothing.

     Needless to say, grave disorder will result  if  the  space  assigned  by
     <STRONG>malloc</STRONG> is overrun or if some random number is handed to <STRONG>free</STRONG>.

     <STRONG>Malloc</STRONG> maintains  multiple  lists  of  free  blocks  according  to  size,
     allocating  space  from the appropriate list.  It calls <STRONG>sbrk</STRONG> (see <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/brk.2.html">brk(2)</A></STRONG>)
     to get more memory from the  system  when  there  is  no  suitable  space
     already free.

     <STRONG>Realloc</STRONG> changes the size of the block pointed to by <EM>ptr</EM> to <EM>size</EM> bytes and
     returns  a  pointer  to the (possibly moved) block.  The contents will be
     unchanged up to the lesser of the new and old sizes.  A call with a  null
     <EM>ptr</EM> is legal and has the same result as <STRONG>malloc(</STRONG><EM>size</EM><STRONG>)</STRONG>.

     <STRONG>Calloc</STRONG> allocates space for an array of <EM>nelem</EM> elements of size <EM>elsize</EM>. The
     space is initialized to zeros.

     <STRONG>Alloca</STRONG> allocates <EM>size</EM> bytes of space in the stack frame  of  the  caller.
     This temporary space is automatically freed on return.

     Each of the allocation routines  returns  a  pointer  to  space  suitably
     aligned  (after  possible  pointer  coercion)  for storage of any type of
     object.

</PRE>
<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Malloc</STRONG>, <STRONG>realloc</STRONG> and <STRONG>calloc</STRONG> return a null pointer if there is no available
     memory  or  if the arena has been detectably corrupted by storing outside
     the bounds of a block.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
     Other implementations of <STRONG>malloc</STRONG>, <STRONG>realloc</STRONG> or  <STRONG>calloc</STRONG>  may  return  a  null
     pointer  if the size of the requested block is zero.  This implementation
     will always return a zero length block  at  a  unique  address,  but  you
     should  keep in mind that a null return is possible if the program is run
     to another system and that this should  not  be  mistakenly  seen  as  an
     error.


</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     When <STRONG>realloc</STRONG> returns a null pointer, the block pointed to by <EM>ptr</EM>  may  be
     destroyed.

     <STRONG>Alloca</STRONG> is machine dependent; its use is discouraged.
