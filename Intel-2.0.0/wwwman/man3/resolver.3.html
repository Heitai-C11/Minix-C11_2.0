<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     These routines are used for making, sending and  interpreting  query  and
     reply messages with Internet domain name servers.

     Global configuration and state information that is used by  the  resolver
     routines  is  kept  in  the  structure  _<EM>res</EM>.   Most  of  the values have
     reasonable defaults and can be ignored.  Options stored  in  _<EM>res</EM>.<EM>options</EM>
     are  defined  in  <EM>resolv</EM>.<EM>h</EM>  and  are as follows.  Options are stored as a
     simple bit mask containing the bitwise ``or'' of the options enabled.

     RES_INIT
          True if the initial name server address and default domain name  are
          initialized (i.e., <EM>res</EM>_<EM>init</EM> has been called).

     RES_DEBUG
          Print debugging messages.

     RES_AAONLY
          Accept authoritative  answers  only.   With  this  option,  <EM>res</EM>_<EM>send</EM>
          should  continue  until it finds an authoritative answer or finds an
          error.  Currently this is not implemented.

     RES_USEVC
          Use TCP connections for queries instead of UDP datagrams.

     RES_STAYOPEN
          Used with RES_USEVC to keep the TCP connection open between queries.
          This is useful only in programs that regularly do many queries.  UDP
          should be the normal mode used.

     RES_IGNTC
          Unused currently (ignore truncation errors, i.e., don't  retry  with
          TCP).

     RES_RECURSE
          Set the recursion-desired bit in  queries.   This  is  the  default.
          (<EM>res</EM>_<EM>send</EM>  does not do iterative queries and expects the name server
          to handle recursion.)

     RES_DEFNAMES
          If set, <EM>res</EM>_<EM>search</EM> will append the default domain  name  to  single-
          component  names  (those that do not contain a dot).  This option is
          enabled by default.

     RES_DNSRCH
          If this option is set, <EM>res</EM>_<EM>search</EM> will search for host names in  the
          current domain and in parent domains; see <STRONG><A HREF="../man7/hostname.7.html">hostname(7)</A></STRONG>.  This is used
          by the standard host lookup routine <STRONG><A HREF="../man3/gethostbyname.3.html">gethostbyname(3)</A></STRONG>.   This  option
          is enabled by default.

     The  <EM>res</EM>_<EM>init</EM>  routine  reads  the  configuration  file  (if   any;   see
     <STRONG><A HREF="../man5/resolver.5.html">resolver(5)</A></STRONG>) to get the default domain name, search list and the Internet
     address of the local name server(s).  If no  server  is  configured,  the
     host  running  the resolver is tried.  The current domain name is defined
     by the hostname if not specified in the configuration  file;  it  can  be
     overridden  by  the  environment  variable  LOCALDOMAIN.   Initialization
     normally occurs on the first call to one of the following routines.

     The  <EM>res</EM>_<EM>query</EM>  function  provides  an  interface  to  the  server  query
     mechanism.  It constructs a query, sends it to the local server, awaits a
     response, and makes preliminary checks on the reply.  The query  requests
     information  of  the  specified  <EM>type</EM>  and <EM>class</EM> for the specified fully-
     qualified domain name <EM>dname</EM> . The reply message is  left  in  the  <EM>answer</EM>
     buffer with length <EM>anslen</EM> supplied by the caller.

     The  <EM>res</EM>_<EM>search</EM>  routine  makes  a  query  and  awaits  a  response  like
     <EM>res</EM>_<EM>query</EM>,  but  in  addition, it implements the default and search rules
     controlled by the RES_DEFNAMES and RES_DNSRCH options.   It  returns  the
     first successful reply.

     The remaining routines are lower-level routines used by  <EM>res</EM>_<EM>query</EM>.   The
     <EM>res</EM>_<EM>mkquery</EM> function constructs a standard query message and places it in
     <EM>buf</EM>.  It returns the size of the query, or -1 if the query is larger than
     <EM>buflen</EM>.   The query type <EM>op</EM> is usually QUERY, but can be any of the query
     types defined in &lt;<EM>arpa</EM>/<EM>nameser</EM>.<EM>h</EM>&gt;.  The domain  name  for  the  query  is
     given  by  <EM>dname</EM>.   <EM>Newrr</EM>  is currently unused but is intended for making
     update messages.

     The <EM>res</EM>_<EM>send</EM> routine sends a pre-formatted query and returns  an  answer.
     It will call <EM>res</EM>_<EM>init</EM> if RES_INIT is not set, send the query to the local
     name server, and handle timeouts and retries.  The length  of  the  reply
     message is returned, or -1 if there were errors.

     The <EM>dn</EM>_<EM>comp</EM> function compresses the domain name <EM>exp</EM>_<EM>dn</EM> and stores  it  in
     <EM>comp</EM>_<EM>dn</EM>.  The size of the compressed name is returned or -1 if there were
     errors.  The size of the array pointed to by <EM>comp</EM>_<EM>dn</EM> is given by  <EM>length</EM>.
     The compression uses an array of pointers <EM>dnptrs</EM> to previously-compressed
     names in the current  message.   The  first  pointer  points  to  to  the
     beginning  of  the message and the list ends with NULL.  The limit to the
     array is specified by <EM>lastdnptr</EM>.  A side effect of <EM>dn</EM>_<EM>comp</EM> is  to  update
     the  list of pointers for labels inserted into the message as the name is
     compressed.  If <EM>dnptr</EM> is NULL, names are not compressed.  If <EM>lastdnptr</EM> is
     NULL, the list of labels is not updated.

     The <EM>dn</EM>_<EM>expand</EM> entry expands the compressed domain name <EM>comp</EM>_<EM>dn</EM> to a  full
     domain name The compressed name is contained in a query or reply message;
     <EM>msg</EM> is a pointer to the beginning of the message.  The uncompressed  name
     is placed in the buffer indicated by <EM>exp</EM>_<EM>dn</EM> which is of size <EM>length</EM>.  The
     size of compressed name is returned or -1 if there was an error.
