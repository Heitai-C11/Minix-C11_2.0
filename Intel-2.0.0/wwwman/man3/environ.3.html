<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     These routines provide various interfaces  to  the  <STRONG>execve</STRONG>  system  call.
     Refer  to  <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</A></STRONG>  for  a  description of their properties; only brief
     descriptions are provided here.

     <STRONG>Exec</STRONG> in all its forms overlays the calling process with the  named  file,
     then  transfers  to the entry point of the core image of the file.  There
     can be no return from a successful exec; the calling core image is lost.

     The <EM>name</EM> argument is a pointer to the name of the file  to  be  executed.
     The   pointers  <EM>arg</EM>[<EM>0</EM>],  <EM>arg</EM>[<EM>1</EM>]  ...   address  null-terminated  strings.
     Conventionally <EM>arg</EM>[<EM>0</EM>] is the name of the file.

     Two interfaces are available.  <STRONG>execl</STRONG> is useful when  a  known  file  with
     known arguments is being called; the arguments to <STRONG>execl</STRONG> are the character
     strings constituting the file and the arguments; the  first  argument  is
     conventionally the same as the file name (or its last component).  A null
     pointer argument must end the  argument  list.   (Note  that  the  <STRONG>execl*</STRONG>
     functions  are  variable argument functions.  This means that the type of
     the arguments beyond <EM>arg0</EM> is not checked.  So the null  pointer  requires
     an explicit cast to type <STRONG>(char</STRONG> <STRONG>*)</STRONG> if not of that type already.)

     The <STRONG>execv</STRONG> version is useful when the number of arguments  is  unknown  in
     advance;  the  arguments to <STRONG>execv</STRONG> are the name of the file to be executed
     and a vector of strings containing  the  arguments.   The  last  argument
     string must be followed by a null pointer.

     When a C program is executed, it is called as follows:

          <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>main(int</STRONG> <EM>argc</EM><STRONG>,</STRONG> <STRONG>char</STRONG> <STRONG>*const</STRONG> <EM>argv</EM><STRONG>[],</STRONG> <STRONG>char</STRONG> <STRONG>*const</STRONG> <EM>envp</EM><STRONG>[]);</STRONG>

          <STRONG>exit(main(</STRONG><EM>argc</EM><STRONG>,</STRONG> <EM>argv</EM><STRONG>,</STRONG> <EM>envp</EM><STRONG>));</STRONG>



     where <EM>argc</EM> is the argument count  and  <EM>argv</EM>  is  an  array  of  character
     pointers   to   the   arguments   themselves.    As  indicated,  <EM>argc</EM>  is
     conventionally at least one and the first member of the array points to a
     string containing the name of the file.

     <EM>Argv</EM> is directly usable in another <STRONG>execv</STRONG> because <EM>argv</EM>[<EM>argc</EM>] is 0.

     <EM>Envp</EM> is a pointer to an array of strings that constitute the  <EM>environment</EM>
     of  the  process.   Each  string  consists of a name, an "=", and a null-
     terminated value.  The array of pointers is terminated by a null pointer.
     The  shell  <STRONG><A HREF="../man1/sh.1.html">sh(1)</A></STRONG>  passes  an  environment  entry  for  each global shell
     variable defined when the program is called.   See  <STRONG><A HREF="../man7/environ.7.html">environ(7)</A></STRONG>  for  some
     conventionally  used  names.   The  C run-time start-off routine places a
     copy of <EM>envp</EM> in the global cell <STRONG>environ</STRONG>, which is used by <STRONG>execv</STRONG> and <STRONG>execl</STRONG>
     to  pass  the  environment  to  any  subprograms  executed by the current
     program.

     <STRONG>Execlp</STRONG> and <STRONG>execvp</STRONG> are called with the same arguments as <STRONG>execl</STRONG> and  <STRONG>execv</STRONG>,
     but  duplicate the shell's actions in searching for an executable file in
     a  list  of  directories.   The  directory  list  is  obtained  from  the
     environment variable <STRONG>PATH</STRONG>.  Under standard Minix, if a file is found that
     is executable, but does not have the proper executable header then it  is
     assumed  to  be  a  shell  script.   <STRONG>Execlp</STRONG> and <STRONG>execvp</STRONG> execute <STRONG>/bin/sh</STRONG> to
     interpret the script.  Under Minix-vmd this does  not  happen,  a  script
     must  begin with <STRONG>#!</STRONG> and the full path name of the interpreter if it is to
     be an executable script.

<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2><PRE>
     If the file cannot be found, if it is not  executable,  if  it  does  not
     start  with  a  valid  magic  number (see <STRONG><A HREF="../man5/a.out.5.html">a.out(5)</A></STRONG>), if maximum memory is
     exceeded,  or  if  the  arguments  require  too  much  space,  a   return
     constitutes  the  diagnostic;  the return value is -1 and <STRONG>errno</STRONG> is set as
     for <STRONG>execve</STRONG>.  Even for the  super-user,  at  least  one  of  the  execute-
     permission bits must be set for a file to be executed.
