<STRONG>Command:</STRONG>   <STRONG>kermit</STRONG> <STRONG>-</STRONG> <STRONG>transfer</STRONG> <STRONG>a</STRONG> <STRONG>file</STRONG> <STRONG>using</STRONG> <STRONG>the</STRONG> <STRONG>kermit</STRONG> <STRONG>protocol</STRONG>
<STRONG>Syntax:</STRONG>    <STRONG>kermit</STRONG>
<STRONG>Flags:</STRONG>     (many)
<STRONG>Example:</STRONG>   kermit                   # Start kermit

     This is a slightly  lobotomized  <EM>kermit</EM>.   The  help  command,  the
script facility, and the automatic dial support have been removed. The ?
and ESC commands still work, so there is still reasonable built-in help.
The  only  V7  <EM>kermit</EM>  feature  that does not work is the ability to see
whether there are input characters waiting.  This means  that  you  will
not be able to ask for status during a file transfer (though this is not
critical, because <EM>kermit</EM> prints a dot every so often and  other  special
characters whenever there is an error or timeout).

     Start <EM>kermit</EM>, and then type the  following  to  open  a  2400  baud
session, for example:

        <STRONG>set</STRONG> <STRONG>line</STRONG> <STRONG>/dev/tty1</STRONG>
        <STRONG>set</STRONG> <STRONG>speed</STRONG> <STRONG>2400</STRONG>
        <STRONG>connect</STRONG>

(It is more convenient if you put these commands in .<EM>kermrc</EM> in your home
directory, so that they get done automatically whenever you run <EM>kermit</EM>.)
This will connect you to the modem or whatever on the serial port.   Now
log into the other system.

     When you want to transfer files, run <EM>kermit</EM> on  the  other  system.
To it, type

        <STRONG>server</STRONG>

This puts its <EM>kermit</EM> into a  sort  of  'slave  mode'  where  it  expects
commands from the <EM>kermit</EM> running on your MINIX system.  Now come back to
the command level on  MINIX  <EM>kermit</EM>,  by  typing  the  escape  character
followed  by <EM>c</EM>.  (<EM>Kermit</EM> will tell you the current escape character when
you do the connect command.)   At  this  point  you  can  issue  various
commands.  Your  <EM>kermit</EM>  will coordinate things with <EM>kermit</EM> on the other
machine so that you only have to  type  commands  at  one  end.   Common
commands are

        <STRONG>get</STRONG> <EM>filename</EM>
        <STRONG>put</STRONG> <EM>filename</EM>
        <STRONG>remote</STRONG> <EM>dir</EM>

Filenames can include wildcards.  By default, <EM>kermit</EM> works in a  system-
independent,  text  mode.  (In effect it assumes that the whole world is
MS-DOS and converts end of line and file names  accordingly.)   To  send
binary files, you will want to type

        <STRONG>set</STRONG> <STRONG>file</STRONG> <STRONG>type</STRONG> <STRONG>bin</STRONG>

on both ends before starting any transfers.   This  disables  CR  LF  to
newline  conversion.   If  both of your systems are some flavor of UNIX,
you might as well put this in .<EM>kermrc</EM> on both ends  and  run  in  binary
mode  all  the  time.   Also, if both systems are UNIX it is recommended
that you use

        <STRONG>set</STRONG> <STRONG>file</STRONG> <STRONG>name</STRONG> <STRONG>lit</STRONG>

on both ends.  This causes it to keep file names unchanged, rather  than
mapping to legal MS-DOS names.

     Here is a typical .<EM>kermrc</EM> for use on MINIX:

        <STRONG>set</STRONG> <STRONG>line</STRONG> <STRONG>/dev/tty1</STRONG>
        <STRONG>set</STRONG> <STRONG>speed</STRONG> <STRONG>1200</STRONG>
        <STRONG>set</STRONG> <STRONG>esc</STRONG> <STRONG>29</STRONG>
        <STRONG>set</STRONG> <STRONG>file</STRONG> <STRONG>type</STRONG> <STRONG>bin</STRONG>
        <STRONG>set</STRONG> <STRONG>file</STRONG> <STRONG>name</STRONG> <STRONG>lit</STRONG>
        <STRONG>set</STRONG> <STRONG>retry</STRONG> <STRONG>90</STRONG>
        <STRONG>set</STRONG> <STRONG>prompt</STRONG> <STRONG>MINIX</STRONG> <STRONG>kermit&gt;</STRONG>
        <STRONG>connect</STRONG>

     On the other end of the line, for example, the host at  your  local
computer  center  to which you want to transfer files, a typical profile
might be:

        <STRONG>set</STRONG> <STRONG>rec</STRONG> <STRONG>packet</STRONG> <STRONG>1000</STRONG>
        <STRONG>set</STRONG> <STRONG>fil</STRONG> <STRONG>name</STRONG> <STRONG>lit</STRONG>
        <STRONG>set</STRONG> <STRONG>fil</STRONG> <STRONG>type</STRONG> <STRONG>bin</STRONG>
        <STRONG>server</STRONG>


     <EM>Kermit</EM> has many other options and features.   For  a  pleasant  and
highly readable description of it, see the following book:

Over 400 versions of <EM>kermit</EM> are available, so it is likely there is  one
for  any  computer  your  MINIX  system might want to talk to.  Columbia
University  also  publishes  a  newsletter  about  <EM>kermit</EM>  that  can  be
