<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>

     <EM>Term</EM> allows MINIX to talk to a terminal or modem over RS232 port 1.   The
     program  first  sets  the baudrate, parity and character length, and then
     forks.  The parent sits  in  a  loop  copying  from  <EM>stdin</EM>  (usually  the
     console's  keyboard),  to  the  terminal or modem (/<EM>dev</EM>/<EM>tty00</EM>). The child
     sits in a loop  copying  from  the  terminal  or  modem  (/<EM>dev</EM>/<EM>tty00</EM>)  to
     standard  output.  Thus  when RS232 port 1 is connected to a modem, every
     keystroke typed on the keyboard is sent to the modem, and every character
     arriving  from  the modem is displayed.  Standard input and output may be
     redirected, to  provide  a  primitive  file  transfer  program,  with  no
     checking.  Any argument that starts with a minus ('-') is sent out to the
     modem, usually to dial out.   <EM>Term</EM>  accepts  several  commands  that  are
     formed  by typing the escape character, CTRL-], and a letter.  Type CTRL-
     ]? to see a list of commands.  The subshell command is very important, it
     allows  you  to  type  in a ZMODEM command to transfer data.  Do not quit
     <EM>term</EM> to do this, or your modem line will be reset!  <EM>Term</EM> keeps the  modem
     line  open  on  file  descriptor 9 while running the subshell, so you can
     type

           &lt;&amp;9 &gt;&amp;9

     at the end of your ZMODEM command to connect it to the modem.

     Important note:  to  use  <EM>term</EM>,  it  is  essential  that  /<EM>etc</EM>/<EM>ttytab</EM>  is
     configured  so that there is no shell hanging on /<EM>dev</EM>/<EM>tty01</EM>. If there is,
     both the shell and term will try to read  from  /<EM>dev</EM>/<EM>tty01</EM>,  and  nothing
     will work.
