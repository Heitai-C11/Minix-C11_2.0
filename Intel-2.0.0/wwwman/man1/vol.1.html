     vol - split input on or combine output from several volumes

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>vol</STRONG> [<STRONG>-rw1</STRONG>] [<STRONG>-b</STRONG> <EM>blocksize</EM>] [<STRONG>-m</STRONG> <EM>multiple</EM>] [<EM>size</EM>] <EM>device</EM>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Vol</STRONG> either reads a large input stream from standard input and distributes
     it  over  several  volumes or combines volumes and sends them to standard
     output.  The size of the  volumes  is  determined  automatically  if  the
     device supports this, but may be specified before the argument naming the
     device if automated detection is not possible or  if  only  part  of  the
     physical  volume  is  used.   The  direction of the data is automatically
     determined by checking whether the input or output of <STRONG>vol</STRONG> is  a  file  or
     pipe.   Use  the  <STRONG>-r</STRONG>  or  <STRONG>-w</STRONG>  flag  if  you want to specify the direction
     explicitly, in shell scripts for instance.

     <STRONG>Vol</STRONG> waits for each new volume to be  inserted,  typing  return  makes  it
     continue.  If no size is explicitely given then the size of the device is
     determined each time before it is read or written, so it is  possible  to
     mix  floppies  of  different  sizes.   If  the  size cannot be determined
     (probably a tape) then the device is assumed to be infinitely  big.   <STRONG>Vol</STRONG>
     can be used both for block or character devices.  It will buffer the data
     and use a block size appropriate for fixed or variable block sized tapes.

     <STRONG>Vol</STRONG> reads or writes  8192  bytes  to  block  devices,  usually  floppies.
     Character  devices  are  read  or  written using a multiple of 512 bytes.
     This multiple has an upper limit of 32767 bytes (16-bit machine),  64  kb
     (32-bit),  or  even  1  Mb  (32-bit  VM).   The  last  partial write to a
     character device is padded with zeros to the block size.  If a  character
     device is a tape device that responds to the <STRONG><A HREF="../man4/mtio.4.html">mtio(4)</A></STRONG> status call then the
     reported tape block size will be used as the smallest unit.  If the  tape
     is a variable block length device then it is read or written like a block
     device, 8192 bytes at the time, with a minimum unit of one byte.

     All sizes may be suffixed by the letters <STRONG>M</STRONG>, <STRONG>k</STRONG>, <STRONG>b</STRONG> or  <STRONG>w</STRONG>  to  multiply  the
     number  by  mega,  kilo,  block  (512),  or word (2).  The volume size by
     default in kilobytes if there is no suffix.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>

     <STRONG>-rw</STRONG>  Explicitly specify reading or writing.  Almost mandatory in scripts.

     <STRONG>-1</STRONG>   Just one volume, start immediately.

     <STRONG>-b</STRONG> <EM>blocksize</EM>
          Specify the device block size.



     <STRONG>-m</STRONG> <EM>multiple</EM>
          Specify the maximum read or write size of multiple blocks.   The  <STRONG>-b</STRONG>
          and  <STRONG>-m</STRONG>  options allow one to modify the block size assumptions that
          are made above.  These assumptions  are  <STRONG>-b</STRONG>  <STRONG>1</STRONG>  <STRONG>-m</STRONG>  <STRONG>8192</STRONG>  for  block
          devices  or variable length tapes, and <STRONG>-b</STRONG> <STRONG>512</STRONG> <STRONG>-m</STRONG> <STRONG>65536</STRONG> for character
          devices (32 bit machine.)  These options will not override the  tape
          block  size  found  out  with  an <STRONG><A HREF="../man4/mtio.4.html">mtio(4)</A></STRONG> call.  The multiple may be
          larger then the default if <STRONG>vol</STRONG> can allocate the memory required.

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2><PRE>
     To back up a tree to floppies as a compressed tarfile:

          tar cf - . | compress | vol /dev/fd0

     To restore a tree from 720 kb images from possibly bigger floppies:

          vol 720 /dev/fd0 | uncompress | tar xfp -

     Read or write a device with 1024 byte blocks:

          vol -b 1k /dev/rsd15

     Read or write a variable block length tape using blocking  factor  20  as
     used by default by many <STRONG><A HREF="../man1/tar.1.html">tar(1)</A></STRONG> commands:

          vol -m 20b /dev/rst5

     Note that <STRONG>-m</STRONG> was used in the last example.  It sets the size  to  use  to
     read  or  write,  <STRONG>-b</STRONG>  sets  the  basic  block size that may be written in
     multiples.
