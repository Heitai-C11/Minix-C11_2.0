<H2>EXAMPLES</H2><PRE>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>

     MINIX allows files that have been deleted (e.g., with <EM>rm</EM>) to be  restored
     (in  /<EM>tmp</EM>).  The trick is that when a file is unlinked, its i-node number
     is kept in the directory entry.  As long as the directory entry and  disk
     blocks  are  not  reused,  the  file  can  be recovered.  This program is
     actually just a little front end for <EM>de</EM>, which must  be  installed  as  a
     set-uid root executable.
