<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>

     This is the C compiler.  It has eight passes, as follows:

        <STRONG>Program</STRONG>   <STRONG>Input</STRONG>   <STRONG>Output</STRONG>   <STRONG>Operation</STRONG> <STRONG>performed</STRONG>
        lib/ncpp  prog.c  prog.i   C preprocessor: #include, #define, #ifdef
        lib/irrel prog.i  prog.i   Removal of unnecessary prototypes
        lib/ncem  prog.i  prog.k   Parsing and semantic analysis
        lib/nopt  prog.k  prog.m   Optimization of the intermediate code
        lib/ncg   prog.m  prog.s   Code generation
        bin/as    prog.s  prog.o   Assembly
        lib/ld    prog.o  prog.out Linking
        lib/cv    prog.out a.out   Conversion to MINIX a.out format

     In the 68000 versions of MINIX , the preprocessor is not called since the
     front-end contains the preprocessor.  This increases compilation speed.

     The  main  program,  <EM>cc</EM>  ,  forks  appropriately  to  call  the   passes,
     transmitting  flags  and  arguments.  The <STRONG>-v</STRONG> flag causes the passes to be
     listed as they are called, and the <STRONG>-vn</STRONG>  flag  causes  the  passes  to  be
     listed but not called.

     The libraries should be made with <EM>aal</EM> (which is the same  as  <EM>ar</EM>  on  the
     68000  versions),  and  consist of .o files.  The internal order of files
     inside the library is unimportant, but the order in which  the  libraries
     are specified is.

     When <STRONG>-T</STRONG>  is  used,  the  intermediate  files  end  up  in  the  directory
     specified.   Otherwise,  <STRONG>/tmp</STRONG>  is  used.   When  available memory is very
     limited (e.g., a 512K machine), it may  be  necessary  to  run  <EM>chmem</EM>  to
     reduce the sizes of the compiler passes that do not fit, typically <EM>ncem</EM> .

     On the other hand, if the compiler (or,  in  fact,  almost  any  program)
     begins  acting  strange,  it  is  almost always due to its running out of
     space, either stack space or scratch file space.  The relevant  pass  can
     be  given more stack space using <EM>chmem</EM> . More space for scratch files can
     be obtained by removing other files on the device.
     If the compiler runs out of memory, it may be necessary  to  use  the  <STRONG>-m</STRONG>
     flag.   This causes <EM>irrel</EM> to be run, which removes unnecessary prototypes
     and thus frees  up  extra  table  space  within  the  compiler.   Beware,
     however, that running this pass may cause strictly conforming programs to
     become non-conforming and vice versa, so you should only run this pass as
     a last resort.

     The  compiler  is  derived  from  the  ACK  system  (Tanenbaum  et   al.,
     <EM>Communications</EM>  <EM>of</EM>  <EM>the</EM>  <EM>ACM</EM>,  Sept.  1983), not from the AT&amp;T portable C
     compiler.  It  has  been  shoehorned  onto  the  PC  with  some  loss  of
     performance.
