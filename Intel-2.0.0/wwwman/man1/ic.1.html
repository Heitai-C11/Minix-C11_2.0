<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>

     <EM>Ic</EM> is a simple RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) calculator, used  for  small
     calculations and base conversions. All calculations are done using 32 bit
     integers.  The standard input is usually  a  keyboard  and  the  standard
     output  requires  a device with a 'termcap' entry.  The program starts by
     interpreting  any  &lt;args&gt;  as  commands,  where  the  separation  between
     arguments is considered to be the same as the ENTER key. For example,

             <STRONG>ic</STRONG> <STRONG>692</STRONG> <STRONG>784+</STRONG>

     After reading the arguments input is from the keyboard.

  <STRONG>Stack</STRONG> <STRONG>Operations</STRONG>

     The operation of this program is similar to an  RPN  calculator.   A  six
     level  stack  is  used.  The ENTER key pushes the stack up one level. For
     example, '12+5' is entered as '12 ENTER 5 +".

     The top two entries on the stack are exchanged by the <EM>x</EM> command, and  the
     stack is rolled down one (popped) by the <EM>p</EM> key.  The top of the stack may
     be cleared by pressing the  back-space  key.  The  whole  stack  and  the
     registers are initialized by a <EM>z</EM>.

  <STRONG>Numeric</STRONG> <STRONG>Entry</STRONG>

     The input and output bases are initially decimal, but they may be changed
     using  the  <EM>i</EM> and <EM>o</EM> commands. The <EM>i</EM> command changes both bases, but the <EM>o</EM>
     command changes  just  the  output  base.   These  commands  take  a  one
     character  argument  of  <EM>h</EM>,  <EM>d</EM>, <EM>o</EM> or <EM>b</EM> to change to Hexadecimal, Decimal,
     Octal or Binary. While the  input  base  is  hexadecimal  the  letters  <EM>a</EM>
     through <EM>f</EM> are used to represent the decimal values 10 through 15.

     When the input base  is  decimal:  multiply,  divide  and  remainder  are
     signed, otherwise they are performed unsigned.



     The output base may also be changed to ASCII (<EM>a</EM>), this causes  the  least
     significant 7 bits of a value to be displayed as a character. To input an
     ASCII value the translate  (<EM>t</EM>)  command  may  be  used,  it  accepts  one
     character as its argument.

  <STRONG>Calculations</STRONG>

     The  arithmetic  operations  supported  are:  Negate  ('.'),  Add  ('+'),
     Subtract  ('-'),  Multiply ('*'), Divide ('/'), and Remainder ('%').  The
     logical (Boolean) operations available are:  NOT  ('~'),  AND  ('&amp;'),  OR
     ('|'), and EXCLUSIVE-OR ('^').

     After one of these operations the last top of stack value  is  saved.  It
     may be restored by pressing <EM>l</EM> (L).

  <STRONG>Saving</STRONG> <STRONG>Results</STRONG>

     Ten temporary registers are available. The Store (<EM>s</EM>) command followed  by
     a  digit  ('0'..'9')  will  copy  the  top  of the stack to the specified
     register. The Recall (<EM>r</EM>) command pushes the contents of a  register  onto
     the top of the stack.

     If the Store command is followed by a '+' preceding the digit,  then  the
     top of the stack will be added to the specified 'accumulator' register.

     Values may also be written to a file. The <EM>w</EM> command writes the top of the
     stack,  using  the  current  output  base,  to a file called 'pad' in the
     current directory.  If the user does not have write access to the current
     directory  then  the  file /<EM>tmp</EM>/<EM>pad</EM>_$<EM>USER</EM> is used as the scratch pad. The
     scratch pad file is erased on the first use of the <EM>w</EM> command within  each
     new invocation of 'ic'.

  <STRONG>Miscellaneous</STRONG>

     The Quit (<EM>q</EM>) key causes an immediate  exit.  The  <EM>m</EM>  command  temporarily
     leaves  <EM>ic</EM>  by invoking the shell as a sub-process.  For help while using
     <EM>ic</EM>, hit the <EM>h</EM> key. If an erroneous key is pressed the bell will sound.

  <STRONG>Command</STRONG> <STRONG>Summary</STRONG>

     Note that many commands have an alternative  key-code  available  on  the
     extended  AT  keyboard. This aids entry by including most commands on the
     right side of the keyboard.
