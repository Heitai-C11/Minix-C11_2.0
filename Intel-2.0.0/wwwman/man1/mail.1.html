<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>

     <EM>Mail</EM> is an extremely simple electronic mail program.  It can be  used  to
     send  or  receive  email  on  a  single  MINIX  system,  in which case it
     functions as user agent and local delivery agent. If the flag  <EM>MAILER</EM>  is
     defined  in  <EM>mail</EM>.<EM>c</EM>,  it can also call a transport agent to handle remote
     mail as well.  No such agent is supplied with MINIX.

     When  called  by  <EM>user</EM>  with  no  arguments,  it  examines  the   mailbox
     /<EM>usr</EM>/<EM>spool</EM>/<EM>mail</EM>/<EM>user</EM>,  prints one message (depending on the <STRONG>-r</STRONG> flag), and
     waits for one of the following commands:

        &lt;newline&gt;   Go to the next message
        -           Print the previous message
        !command    Fork off a shell and execute <EM>command</EM>
        CTRL-D      Update the mailbox and quit (same as q)
        d           Delete the current message and go to the next one
        q           Update the mailbox and quit (same as CTRL-D)
        p           Print the current message again
        s [<EM>file</EM>]    Save message in the named file
        x           Exit without updating the mailbox



     To send mail, the program is called with the name of the recipient as  an
     argument.   The  mail  is sent, along with a postmark line containing the
     date.  For local delivery, a  file  named  after  the  recipient  in  the
     directory /<EM>usr</EM>/<EM>spool</EM>/<EM>mail</EM> must be writable.

     If the directory /<EM>usr</EM>/<EM>spool</EM>/<EM>mail</EM> does not exist then the mail  is  dumped
     on  the console, so that system programs have a way to notify a user on a
     system that does not have a mail spool.
