<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>

     XMODEM, YMODEM, and ZMODEM are a family of protocols that are widely used
     is  the  MS-DOS  world  for  transferring  information  reliably from one
     computer to another.  In all of these protocols, a series  of  bytes  are
     sent  from one computer to the other, and then an acknowledgement is sent
     back to confirm correct reception.  Checksums are used to  detect  errors
     so  that  transmission  is  reliable  even in the face of noisy telephone
     lines.  <EM>Sz</EM> is a program that sends a  file  sent  from  another  computer
     using the zmodem protocol.  The file can be received using <EM>rz</EM>.

     <EM>Sz</EM> uses the ZMODEM error correcting protocol to send one  or  more  files
     over  a dial-in serial port to a variety of programs running under MINIX,
     UNIX, MS-DOS,  CP/M,  VMS,  and  other  operating  systems.   It  is  the
     successor to XMODEM and YMODEM.

     ZMODEM greatly simplifies file transfers compared to XMODEM.  In addition
     to a friendly user interface, ZMODEM provides Personal Computer and other
     users an efficient, accurate, and robust file transfer method.

     ZMODEM provides complete end-to-end data  integrity  between  application
     programs.   ZMODEM's  32  bit CRC catches errors that sneak into even the
     most advanced networks.

     Output from another program may  be  piped  to  <EM>sz</EM>  for  transmission  by
     denoting standard input with -:

             <STRONG>ls</STRONG> <STRONG>-l</STRONG> <STRONG>|</STRONG> <STRONG>sz</STRONG> <STRONG>-</STRONG>

     The program output is transmitted with the filename <EM>sPID</EM>.<EM>sz</EM> where PID  is
     the  process  ID of the <EM>sz</EM> program.  If the environment variable <EM>ONAME</EM> is
     set, that is used instead.  In this case, the command:

             <STRONG>ls</STRONG> <STRONG>-l</STRONG> <STRONG>|</STRONG> <STRONG>ONAME=con</STRONG> <STRONG>sz</STRONG> <STRONG>-ay</STRONG> <STRONG>-</STRONG>

     will send a 'file' to the PC-DOS console display. The <STRONG>-y</STRONG> option instructs
     the  receiver to open the file for writing unconditionally. The <STRONG>-a</STRONG> option
     causes the receiver to convert UNIX newlines to PC-DOS  carriage  returns
     and linefeeds.  On UNIX systems, additional information about the file is
     transmitted.   If  the  receiving  program  uses  this  information,  the
     transmitted file length controls the exact number of bytes written to the
     output dataset, and the modify time and file mode are set accordingly.



     If <EM>sz</EM> is invoked with $SHELL set and if that variable contains the string
     <EM>rsh</EM>   or  <EM>rksh</EM>  (restricted  shell),  <EM>sz</EM>  operates  in  restricted  mode.
     Restricted mode restricts pathnames to the current directory  and  <EM>PUBDIR</EM>
     (usually /<EM>usr</EM>/<EM>spool</EM>/<EM>uucppublic</EM>) and/or subdirectories thereof.

     The options and flags available are:
     <STRONG>-+</STRONG>
        Instruct the receiver to append transmitted data to an existing file.
     <STRONG>-a</STRONG>
        Convert NL characters in the transmitted file to CR/LF.  This is  done
        by the sender for XMODEM and YMODEM, by the receiver for ZMODEM.
     <STRONG>-b</STRONG>
        Binary override: transfer file without any translation.
     <STRONG>-c</STRONG>
        Send COMMAND (follows <EM>c</EM>) to the receiver for  execution,  return  with
        COMMAND's exit status.
     <STRONG>-d</STRONG>
        Change all instances of '.' to '/' in the transmitted pathname.  Thus,
        C.omenB0000  (which  is unacceptable to MS-DOS or CP/M) is transmitted
        as C/omenB0000.  If the resultant filename has more than 8  characters
        in the stem, a '.' is inserted to allow a total of eleven.
     <STRONG>-e</STRONG>
        Escape all control characters; normally XON, XOFF, DLE,  CR-@-CR,  and
        Ctrl-X are escaped.
     <STRONG>-f</STRONG>
        Send Full pathname.  Normally directory prefixes are stripped from the
        transmitted filename.
     <STRONG>-i</STRONG>
        Send COMMAND  (follows  <EM>i</EM>)  to  the  receiver  for  execution,  return
        Immediately  upon  the receiving program's successful reception of the
        command.
     <STRONG>-L</STRONG>
        Use ZMODEM sub-packets of length <EM>n</EM> (follows <EM>L</EM>). A larger <EM>n</EM> (32 &lt;= <EM>n</EM> &lt;=
        1024)  gives  slightly  higher  throughput, a smaller one speeds error
        recovery.  The default is 128 below 300 baud, 256 above 300  baud,  or
        1024 above 2400 baud.
     <STRONG>-l</STRONG>
        Wait for the receiver to acknowledge correct data every <EM>n</EM> (32 &lt;= <EM>n</EM>  &lt;=
        1024)  characters. This may be used to avoid network overrun when XOFF
        flow control is lacking.
     <STRONG>-n</STRONG>
        Send  each  file  if  destination  file  does  not  exist.   Overwrite
        destination file if source file is newer than the destination file.
     <STRONG>-N</STRONG>
         Send each  file  if  destination  file  does  not  exist.   Overwrite
        destination   file  if  source  file  is  newer  or  longer  than  the
        destination file.
     <STRONG>-o</STRONG>
        Disable automatic selection of 32 bit CRC.
     <STRONG>-p</STRONG>
        Protect  existing  destination  files  by  skipping  transfer  if  the
        destination file exists.
     <STRONG>-q</STRONG>
        Quiet suppresses verbosity.
     <STRONG>-r</STRONG>
        Resume interrupted file transfer.  If the source file is  longer  than
        the  destination  file,  the  transfer  commences at the offset in the
        source file that equals the length of the destination file.
     <STRONG>-t</STRONG>
        Change timeout.  The timeout, in tenths of seconds,  follows,  the  <STRONG>-t</STRONG>
        flag.
     <STRONG>-u</STRONG>
        Unlink the file after successful transmission.
     <STRONG>-w</STRONG>
        Limit the transmit window size to <EM>n</EM> bytes (<EM>n</EM> <EM>follows</EM> <STRONG>(enw</STRONG>).
     <STRONG>-v</STRONG>
        Verbose causes a list of file names to be appended to /<EM>tmp</EM>/<EM>szlog</EM>.
     <STRONG>-y</STRONG>
        Instruct a ZMODEM receiving program to  overwrite  any  existing  file
        with the same name.
     <STRONG>-Y</STRONG>
        Instruct a ZMODEM receiving program to  overwrite  any  existing  file
        with  the  same name, and to skip any source files that do have a file
        with the same pathname on the destination system.

  <STRONG>Examples</STRONG>

     Below are some examples of the use of <EM>sz</EM>.

             <STRONG>sz</STRONG> <STRONG>-a</STRONG> <STRONG>d*u.c</STRONG>

     This single command transfers all .c files in the current directory  with
     conversion  (<STRONG>-a</STRONG>)  to end-of-line conventions appropriate to the receiving
     environment.

             <STRONG>sz</STRONG> <STRONG>-Yan</STRONG> <STRONG>d*u.c</STRONG> <STRONG>d*u.h</STRONG>

     Send only the .<EM>c</EM> and .<EM>h</EM> files that exist on both systems, and  are  newer
     on  the  sending  system  than the corresponding version on the receiving
     system, converting MINIX to MS-DOS text format.
