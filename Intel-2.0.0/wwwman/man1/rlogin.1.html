<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Rlogin</STRONG> connects your terminal on the current local host system  <EM>lhost</EM>  to
     the remote host system <EM>rhost</EM>.

     Each host has a file <STRONG>/etc/hosts.equiv</STRONG> which contains a  list  of  <EM>rhost</EM>'s
     with which it shares account names.  (The host names must be the standard
     names as described in <STRONG><A HREF="../man1/rsh.1.html">rsh(1)</A></STRONG>.)  When you <STRONG>rlogin</STRONG> as the same  user  on  an
     equivalent  host,  you don't need to give a password.  Each user may also
     have a private equivalence list in a file .rhosts in his login directory.
     Each  line  in this file should contain an <EM>rhost</EM> and a <EM>username</EM> separated
     by a space, giving additional cases where logins without passwords are to
     be  permitted.   If  the originating user is not equivalent to the remote
     user, then a login and password  will  be  prompted  for  on  the  remote
     machine  as  in  <STRONG><A HREF="../man1/login.1.html">login(1)</A></STRONG>.   To avoid some security problems, the .rhosts
     file must be owned by either the remote user or root.

     The remote terminal type is the same as  your  local  terminal  type  (as
     given in your environment TERM variable).  The terminal or window size is
     also copied to the remote system if the server supports the  option,  and
     changes  in  size  are reflected as well.  All echoing takes place at the
     remote site, so that (except for delays) the rlogin is transparent.  Flow
     control  via ^S and ^Q and flushing of input and output on interrupts are
     handled properly.  The optional argument <STRONG>-8</STRONG>  allows  an  eight-bit  input
     data  path  at  all times; otherwise parity bits are stripped except when
     the remote side's stop and start characters are other  than  ^S/^Q.   The
     argument  <STRONG>-L</STRONG>  allows the rlogin session to be run in litout mode.  A line
     of the form ``~.'' disconnects from the remote host, where ``~''  is  the
     escape  character.   Similarly, the line ``~^Z'' (where ^Z, control-Z, is
     the suspend character) will suspend the rlogin session.  Substitution  of
     the  delayed-suspend  character  (normally  ^Y) for the suspend character
     suspends the send portion of the  rlogin,  but  allows  output  from  the
     remote  system.   A different escape character may be specified by the <STRONG>-e</STRONG>
     option.  There is no space separating this option flag and  the  argument
     character.  With the <STRONG>-E</STRONG> option the escape can be turned off.
