<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     bsfilt, colcrt - a colcrt-like backspace filter


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>bsfilt</STRONG> [ <STRONG>-</STRONG> ] [ <STRONG>-U</STRONG> ] [ file ... ]


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <EM>Bsfilt</EM> filters backspace sequences from the input <EM>file</EM>(s) (standard input
     if  none)  in  an approximation of <STRONG><A HREF="../man1/colcrt.1.html">colcrt(1)</A></STRONG>.  Both the backspace and the
     character it returns to  are  removed,  unless  they  form  an  underline
     sequence.   Underline  sequences are treated according to the settings of
     the <STRONG>-</STRONG> and <STRONG>-U</STRONG> options.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>

     <STRONG>-</STRONG>    specifies that no underlining of  any  kind  is  to  be  propagated.
          Without   this   option   or  the  <STRONG>-U</STRONG>  option,  <EM>bsfilt</EM>  approximates
          underlining with minus signs (`-') in following lines.

     <STRONG>-U</STRONG>   specifies that underlining with underscore (`_') and backspace (`b')
          character sequences is permitted.

<H2>HISTORY</H2><PRE>
     Vic Abell of Purdue University wrote <EM>bsfilt</EM> to have  a  backspace  filter
     for <STRONG><A HREF="../man1/cawf.1.html">cawf(1)</A></STRONG> that is independent of licensed source code.


</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     The maximum length of a line that can be underlined with minus  signs  is
     fixed.

     <EM>Bsfilt</EM> does not examine the characters that  are  being  overprinted  via
     backspace  operations.  Thus, overprinting that is intended to form a new
     character from several different ones is ineffective and  only  the  last
     character  of  the  sequence is propagated - e. g., ``o^H+'', intended to
     look like a bullet, is reduced to `+'.
