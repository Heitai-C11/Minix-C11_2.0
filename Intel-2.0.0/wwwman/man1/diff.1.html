<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     the same name, when <EM>file1</EM> and  <EM>file2</EM>  are  both  directories"  difference
     encountered"

     <EM>Diff</EM> compares two files and generates a list of lines telling how the two
     files  differ.   Lines may not be longer than 128 characters.  If the two
     arguments on the command line  are  both  directories,  <EM>diff</EM>  recursively
     steps  through  all subdirectories comparing files of the same name. If a
     file name is found only in one directory, a diagnostic message is written
     to  <EM>stdout</EM>.  A file that is of either block special, character special or
     FIFO special type, cannot be compared to any other file.   On  the  other
     hand,  if  there is one directory and one file given on the command line,
     <EM>diff</EM> tries to compare the  file  with  the  same  name  as  <EM>file</EM>  in  the
     directory <EM>directory</EM>.
