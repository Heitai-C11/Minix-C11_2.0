<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>yap</STRONG> [ <STRONG>-cnuq</STRONG> ] [ <STRONG>-</STRONG><EM>n</EM> ] [ <STRONG>+</STRONG><EM>command</EM> ] [ name ...  ]

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <EM>Yap</EM> is a program allowing the user  to  examine  a  continuous  text  one
     screenful  at  a time on a video display terminal.  It does so by pausing
     after each screenful, waiting for  the  user  to  type  a  command.   The
     commands  are  enumerated later.  <EM>Yap</EM>'s main feature is, that it can page
     both forwards and backwards, even when reading from standard input.

     The command line options are:

     -<EM>n</EM>   An integer which is the size (in lines) of a page (the initial <EM>page</EM>-
          <EM>size</EM>.

     <STRONG>-c</STRONG>   Normally, <EM>yap</EM> will display each page by beginning at the top of  the
          screen  and erasing each line just before it displays on it. If your
          terminal cannot erase a line, <EM>yap</EM> will clear the  screen  before  it
          displays a page.
          This avoids scrolling the screen, making it easier to read while <EM>yap</EM>
          is  writing.   The <STRONG>-c</STRONG> option causes <EM>yap</EM> to scroll the screen instead
          of beginning at the top of the screen.  This is also  done  if  your
          terminal cannot either erase a line or clear the screen.

     <STRONG>-u</STRONG>   Normally, <EM>yap</EM> handles underlining such as produced  by  nroff  in  a
          manner  appropriate  to the particular terminal: if the terminal can
          perform underlining well (t.i., the escape sequences for underlining
          do  not  occupy  space on the screen), <EM>yap</EM> will underline underlined
          information in the input. The <STRONG>-u</STRONG> option supresses this underlining.

     <STRONG>-n</STRONG>   Normally, <EM>yap</EM> also recognises escape sequences for stand-out mode or
          underlining mode in the input, and knows how much space these escape
          sequences will occupy on the screen, so that <EM>yap</EM> will not fold lines
          erroneously.  The <STRONG>-n</STRONG> option supresses this pattern matching.

     <STRONG>-q</STRONG>   This option will cause <EM>yap</EM> to exit only on the "quit" command.

     <STRONG>+</STRONG><EM>command</EM>
          <EM>command</EM> is taken to be an initial command to <EM>yap</EM>.

     <EM>Yap</EM> uses the <STRONG><A HREF="../man5/termcap.5.html">termcap(5)</A></STRONG> database to determine the  terminal  capabilities
     and the default <EM>page</EM>-<EM>size</EM>.  It examines the $TERM environment variable to
     identify the terminal type.  If $TERM is not set, it  defaults  to  <EM>dumb</EM>.
     <EM>Yap</EM>  Also  examines  the  $TERMCAP  environment  variable  to  locate the
     <STRONG><A HREF="../man5/termcap.5.html">termcap(5)</A></STRONG>  database.   If  $TERMCAP  is  not   set,   it   defaults   to
     /<EM>etc</EM>/<EM>termcap</EM>.

     <EM>Yap</EM> looks in  the  $YAP  environment  variable  to  pre-set  flags.   For
     instance,  if  you  prefer  the  <STRONG>-c</STRONG>  mode of operation, just set the $YAP
     environment variable to <STRONG>-c</STRONG>.

     The commands of <EM>yap</EM>  can  be  bound  to  sequences  of  keystrokes.   The
     environment  variable  $YAPKEYS may contain the bindings in the form of a
     list of colon-separated `name=sequence'  pairs.   The  <EM>name</EM>  is  a  short
     mnemonic  for  the command, the <EM>sequence</EM> is the sequence of keystrokes to
     be typed to invoke the command.  This sequence may contain a  ^X  escape,
     which  means control-X, and a \X escape, which means X. The latter can be
     used to get the characters `^', `\' and `:' in the sequence.   There  are
     two  keymaps  available, the default one and a user-defined one.  You can
     switch between one and the other with the <EM>change</EM> <EM>keymap</EM> command.

     The <EM>yap</EM> commands are described below.  The mnemonics for the commands are
     given  in parentheses. The default key sequences (if any) are given after
     the mnemonic.  Every command takes an optional  integer  argument,  which
     may  be  typed  before  the  command.  Some  commands just ignore it. The
     integer argument is referred to as <EM>i</EM>.  Usually, if <EM>i</EM>  is  not  given,  it
     defaults to 1.

     visit previous file (<EM>bf</EM>) <STRONG>P</STRONG>
          Visit the <EM>i</EM>-th previous file given in the command line.

     scroll one line up or go to line (<EM>bl</EM>) <STRONG>^K</STRONG> or <STRONG>k</STRONG>
          If <EM>i</EM> is not  given,  scroll  one  line  up.  Otherwise,  <EM>i</EM>  will  be
          interpreted  as  a  line  number.  A  page  starting  with  the line
          indicated will then be displayed.

     bottom (<EM>bot</EM>) <STRONG>l</STRONG> or <STRONG>$</STRONG>
          Go to the last line of the input.

     display previous page (<EM>bp</EM>) <STRONG>-</STRONG>
          Display the previous page, consisting  of  <EM>i</EM>  lines,  (or  <EM>page</EM>-<EM>size</EM>
          lines if no argument is given).

     display previous page and set pagesize (<EM>bps</EM>) <STRONG>Z</STRONG>
          Display the previous page, consisting  of  <EM>i</EM>  lines,  (or  <EM>page</EM>-<EM>size</EM>
          lines if no argument is given).  If <EM>i</EM> is given, the <EM>page</EM>-<EM>size</EM> is set
          to <EM>i</EM>.

     scroll up (<EM>bs</EM>) <STRONG>^B</STRONG>
          Scroll up  <EM>i</EM>  lines  (or  <EM>scroll</EM>-<EM>size</EM>  lines  if  <EM>i</EM>  is  not  given.
          Initially, the <EM>scroll</EM>-<EM>size</EM> is 11).

     search backwards for pattern (<EM>bse</EM>) <STRONG>?</STRONG>
          Search backwards for the <EM>i</EM>-th occurrence  of  a  regular  expression
          which will be prompted for.  If there are less than <EM>i</EM> occurrences of
          the  expression,  the  position  in  the  file  remains   unchanged.
          Otherwise,  a page is displayed, starting two lines before the place
          where the expression was found. The user's erase and kill characters
          may  be  used  to  edit the expression.  Erasing back past the first
          character cancels the search command.
          Note: Some systems do not have <STRONG><A HREF="../man3/regex.3.html">regex(3)</A></STRONG>.  On those systems, searches
          are still supported, but regular expressions are not.

     skip lines backwards (<EM>bsl</EM>) <STRONG>S</STRONG>
          Skip <EM>i</EM> lines backwards and display a page.

     skip pages backwards (<EM>bsp</EM>) <STRONG>F</STRONG>

     scroll up and set scrollsize (<EM>bss</EM>) <STRONG>b</STRONG>
          Scroll up <EM>i</EM> lines (or <EM>scroll</EM>-<EM>size</EM> lines if <EM>i</EM> is not given.  If <EM>i</EM>  is
          given, the <EM>scroll</EM>-<EM>size</EM> is set to <EM>i</EM>.

     change key map (<EM>chm</EM>) <STRONG>^[</STRONG>
          Change from the current key map to the other (if there is one).

     exchange current page and mark (<EM>exg</EM>) <STRONG>x</STRONG>

     scroll one line down or go to line (<EM>fl</EM>) <STRONG>^J</STRONG> or <STRONG>^M</STRONG> or <STRONG>j</STRONG>
          If <EM>i</EM> is not given, scroll  one  line  down.  Otherwise,  <EM>i</EM>  will  be
          interpreted  as  a  line  number.  A  page  starting  with  the line
          indicated will then be displayed.

     display next page (<EM>fp</EM>) <STRONG>&lt;space&gt;</STRONG>
          Display the next page, consisting of <EM>i</EM> lines, (or <EM>page</EM>-<EM>size</EM> lines if
          no argument is given).

     display next page and set pagesize (<EM>fps</EM>) <STRONG>z</STRONG>
          Display the next page, consisting of <EM>i</EM> lines, (or <EM>page</EM>-<EM>size</EM> lines if
          no argument is given).  If <EM>i</EM> is given, the <EM>page</EM>-<EM>size</EM> is set to <EM>i</EM>.

     scroll down (<EM>fs</EM>) <STRONG>^D</STRONG>
          Scroll down <EM>i</EM> lines (or <EM>scroll</EM>-<EM>size</EM> lines if no argument is given).

     search forwards for pattern (<EM>fse</EM>) <STRONG>/</STRONG>
          Search forwards for the <EM>i</EM>-th  occurrence  of  a  regular  expression
          which will be prompted for.  If there are less than <EM>i</EM> occurrences of
          the  expression,  the  position  in  the  file  remains   unchanged.
          Otherwise,  a page is displayed, starting two lines before the place
          where the expression was found. The user's erase and kill characters
          may  be  used  to  edit the expression.  Erasing back past the first
          character cancels the search command.
          Note: Some systems do not have <STRONG><A HREF="../man3/regex.3.html">regex(3)</A></STRONG>.  On those systems, searches
          are still supported, but regular expressions are not.

     skip lines forwards (<EM>fsl</EM>) <STRONG>s</STRONG>

     scroll down and set scrollsize (<EM>fss</EM>) <STRONG>d</STRONG>
          Scroll down <EM>i</EM> lines (or <EM>scroll</EM>-<EM>size</EM> lines if <EM>i</EM> is not given.   If  <EM>i</EM>
          is given, the <EM>scroll</EM>-<EM>size</EM> is set to <EM>i</EM>.

     help (<EM>hlp</EM>) <STRONG>h</STRONG>
          Give a short description of all commands that are  bound  to  a  key
          sequence.

     set a mark (<EM>mar</EM>) <STRONG>m</STRONG>
          Set a mark on the current page.

     repeat last search (<EM>nse</EM>) <STRONG>n</STRONG>
          Search for the  <EM>i</EM>-th  occurrence  of  the  last  regular  expression
          entered, in the direction of the last search.

     repeat last search in other direction (<EM>nsr</EM>) <STRONG>r</STRONG>
          Search for the  <EM>i</EM>-th  occurrence  of  the  last  regular  expression
          entered, but in the other direction.

     quit (<EM>qui</EM>) <STRONG>Q</STRONG> or <STRONG>q</STRONG>
          Exit from <EM>yap</EM>.

     redraw (<EM>red</EM>) <STRONG>^L</STRONG>
          Redraw the current page.

     repeat (<EM>rep</EM>) <STRONG>.</STRONG>
          Repeat the last command. This does not always make sense, so not all
          commands can be repeated.

     shell escape (<EM>shl</EM>) <STRONG>!</STRONG>
          Invoke the shell with a command that will be prompted for.   In  the
          command,  the  characters  `%' and `!' are replaced with the current
          file  name  and  the  previous  shell  command  respectively.    The
          sequences  `\%'  and  `\!' are replaced by `%' and `!' respectively.
          The user's erase and  kill  characters  can  be  used  to  edit  the
          command.  Erasing back past the first character cancels the command.

     pipe to shell command (<EM>pip</EM>) <STRONG>|</STRONG>
          Pipe the current input file  into  a  shell  command  that  will  be
          prompted  for.   The  comments given in the description of the shell
          escape command apply here too.

     go to mark (<EM>tom</EM>) <STRONG>'</STRONG>
          Display the marked page.

     top (<EM>top</EM>) <STRONG>^^</STRONG>
          Display a page starting with the first line of the input.

     visit file (<EM>vis</EM>) <STRONG>e</STRONG>
          Visit a new file. The filename will be prompted  for.  If  you  just
          type a return, the current file is revisited.

     write input to a file (<EM>wrf</EM>) <STRONG>w</STRONG>
          Write the input to a file, whose name will be prompted for.

     The commands take effect immediately, i.e., it is not necessary to type a
     carriage  return.   Up  to  the  time when the command sequence itself is
     given, the user may give an interrupt to cancel the command being formed.

     <EM>Yap</EM> will find your terminal very stupid and act like it, if it has no way
     of placing the cursor on the home position, or cannot either erase a line
     or insert one.

     In lines longer than  about  2000  characters,  a  linefeed  is  silently
     inserted.

     The percentage, given in the prompt when <EM>yap</EM> reads from a file (and knows
     it), is not always very accurate.
