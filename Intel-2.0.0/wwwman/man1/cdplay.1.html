<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>cdplay</STRONG> [ -<STRONG>a</STRONG>]|[-<STRONG>r</STRONG>]


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Cdplay</STRONG> is  an  audio-cdplayer  it  can  be  used  interactively  or  non-
     interactively.  With  no  flags  <STRONG>cdplay</STRONG>  is used interactively. When used
     interactively <STRONG>cdplay</STRONG> can be either in non-playing  or  playing  mode.  In
     non-playing  mode  you  can  select  tracks to be played. In playing mode
     <STRONG>cdplay</STRONG>  shows  the  track-time,  remaining  track-time,  total-time   and
     remaining total-time. <STRONG>Cdplay</STRONG> assumes the drive to be at /<EM>dev</EM>/<EM>cd0</EM>.

     During non-playing mode the following commands are available:

     cursor-up/down
          browse through the track-list

     spacebar
          add track to the play-list

     backspace
          remove a track from the play-list

     s    start playing the tracks in the play-list.  When  the  play-list  is
          empty  start  playing  from  the  current position in the track-list
          until the end of the cd

     p    play the track on the current position in the track-list

     r    play all tracks in a random order (shuffle play)

     e    exit cdplay


     During playing mode the following commands are available:

     s    stop playing, return to non-playing mode

     spacebar
          pause/resume current track

     cursor-up/down
          skip to next/previous track

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     When one  of  these  options  is  used  <STRONG>cdplay</STRONG>  does  everything  in  the
     background.

     -a   Play all tracks, <STRONG>cdplay</STRONG> tells the drive to play all tracks and  then
          it immediately returns to the user

     -r   Play all tracks in random order (shuffle play). <STRONG>Cdplay</STRONG>  forks  of  a
          new  process  which  starts up a track, during that track it sleeps.
          When the track is finished it wakes up to start the next  track  and
          goes  to  sleep again. The parent process immediately returns to the
          user.


</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Cdplay</STRONG> does not sense if a cd has changed, so don't switch cd's.  If  you
     want  to  play  another cd you have to insert the new cd and start <STRONG>cdplay</STRONG>
     again.
