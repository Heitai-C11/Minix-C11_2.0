     rcp - remote file copy


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>rcp</STRONG> [<STRONG>-p</STRONG>] <EM>file1</EM> <EM>file2</EM>
     <STRONG>rcp</STRONG> [<STRONG>-pr</STRONG>] <EM>file</EM> ...  <EM>directory</EM>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Rcp</STRONG> copies files between machines.  Each <EM>file</EM> or  <EM>directory</EM>  argument  is
     either  a  remote  file  name of the form ``rhost:path'', or a local file
     name (containing no `:' characters, or a `/' before any `:'s).

     If  the  <STRONG>-r</STRONG>  option  is  specified  and  any  of  the  source  files  are
     directories,  <STRONG>rcp</STRONG>  copies  each subtree rooted at that name; in this case
     the destination must be a directory.

     By default, the mode and owner of  <EM>file2</EM>  are  preserved  if  it  already
     existed;  otherwise  the mode of the source file modified by the <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/umask.2.html">umask(2)</A></STRONG>
     on the destination host is used.  The <STRONG>-p</STRONG> option causes <STRONG>rcp</STRONG> to attempt  to
     preserve  (duplicate)  in  its copies the modification times and modes of
     the source files, ignoring the <STRONG>umask</STRONG>.

     If <EM>path</EM> is not a full path name, it is interpreted relative to your login
     directory  on  <EM>rhost</EM>.  A <EM>path</EM> on a remote host may be quoted (using \, ",
     or ') so that the metacharacters are interpreted remotely.

     <STRONG>Rcp</STRONG> does not prompt for passwords; your  current  local  user  name  must
     exist on <EM>rhost</EM> and allow remote command execution via <STRONG><A HREF="../man1/rsh.1.html">rsh(1)</A></STRONG>.

     <STRONG>Rcp</STRONG> handles third party copies, where neither source nor target files are
     on the current machine.  Hostnames may also take the form ``rname@rhost''
     to use <EM>rname</EM> rather than the current user name on the remote  host.   The
     destination  hostname  may  also take the form ``rhost.rname'' to support
     destination machines that are running 4.2BSD versions of <STRONG>rcp</STRONG>.

</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     Doesn't detect all cases where the target of a copy might be  a  file  in
     cases where only a directory should be legal.
     Is confused by any output generated by commands in a .profile, or  .*shrc
     file on the remote host.
