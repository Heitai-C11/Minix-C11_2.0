<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>

     The $PATH shell variable controls the MINIX search rules.  If  a  command
     <EM>a</EM>.<EM>out</EM>  is  given, the shell first tries to find an executable file in the
     working directory. If that fails, it looks in various system directories,
     such  as  /<EM>bin</EM>  and /<EM>usr</EM>/<EM>bin</EM>. The which command makes the same search and
     gives the absolute path of the program that will be chosen,  followed  by
     other occurrences of the file name along the path.
