<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Install</STRONG> puts executables, manual pages, and library files in their proper
     place  in  the bin, man, and lib directories.  The first two forms of the
     command are like <STRONG><A HREF="../man1/cp.1.html">cp(1)</A></STRONG> copying either one  file  to  another  or  copying
     several files to a directory.  The "<STRONG>-d</STRONG>" form is like <STRONG><A HREF="../man1/mkdir.1.html">mkdir(1)</A></STRONG> with the <STRONG>-p</STRONG>
     flag.  <EM>File1</EM> may be omitted if neither <STRONG>-l</STRONG> nor <STRONG>-c</STRONG> is given to  change  the
     attributes of <EM>file2</EM>.

     Attributes are always copied from the source file,  use  the  options  to
     change.   Note  that  the  source  file's attributes are changed with the
     destination file if they are linked.  So copy the file if you  change  it
     in  a  way  that  makes it read-only.  You would otherwise not be able to
     compile a command again.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>

     <STRONG>-l</STRONG>   Link the destination to the source file instead of copying it.  This
          is  done  to either save space on a file system with both the source
          and the bin directories on it, or to install synonyms to a command.

     <STRONG>-c</STRONG>   Copy the source file to  its  proper  place.   This  option  is  the
          default if <STRONG>-l</STRONG> is not given.  With <STRONG>-l</STRONG>, the file is copied if the link
          fails.

     <STRONG>-s</STRONG>   Strip the destination  file  of  its  symbol  table,  <EM>if</EM>  it  is  an
          executable,  and  <EM>if</EM>  it  is actually copied.  It has no effect on a
          link or a non-executable.

     <STRONG>-z</STRONG>   Compress the executable using <STRONG><A HREF="../man1/compress.1.html">compress(1)</A></STRONG> and prepend a header  line
          that calls <STRONG><A HREF="../man1/zexec.1.html">zexec(1)</A></STRONG> to decompress and execute the binary.  This will
          on average save 40% disk space at the expense of  a  slower  startup
          time.  Like <STRONG>-s</STRONG> the file must be actually copied for the flag to have
          effect.

     <STRONG>-</STRONG><EM>N</EM>   Use <STRONG>gzip</STRONG> <STRONG>-</STRONG><EM>N</EM> to compress the binary.  You may see  up  to  60%  space
          savings,  but  it  will  take much longer.  <EM>N</EM> is a digit from 1 to 9
          telling the compression effort, see <STRONG><A HREF="../man1/gzip.1.html">gzip(1)</A></STRONG>.

     <STRONG>-d</STRONG>   Make a directory, usually to install files in a  separate  directory
          in a library.  Intermediate directories in the path are created with
          the same attributes as the final directory.  Only the attributes  of
          the final directory are set if the directory exists.

     <STRONG>-o</STRONG> <EM>owner</EM>
          Set the owner of the target.  This only works if the invoker is  the
          super-user,  or  if  <STRONG>install</STRONG> is run setuid root and the invoker is a
          member of group zero.  If <STRONG>-o</STRONG> is omitted then the ownership is copied
          from the source file, or set to the id of the invoker if a directory
          is made.

     <STRONG>-g</STRONG> <EM>group</EM>
          Like <STRONG>-o</STRONG>, but for the group ownership of the target.

     <STRONG>-m</STRONG> <EM>mode</EM>
          <EM>Mode</EM> is an octal number that specifies the mode  the  target  should
          get.   The  default  is  the  source  file's  mode with a <STRONG>chmod</STRONG> <STRONG>a+rX</STRONG>
          applied to it, or 755 for a new directory.  Implies <STRONG>-o</STRONG> <STRONG>0</STRONG>, or <STRONG>-g</STRONG> <STRONG>0</STRONG> if
          a file is to be set-uid or set-gid and the invoker has permission to
          change ownership.  This trick allows a group  0  member  to  install
          third  party  software,  even  though  it expects to be installed by
          root.

     <STRONG>-S</STRONG> <EM>stack</EM>
          Sets the maximum amount of heap + stack that an executable may  have
          when   running.   The  argument  is  a  C-style  decimal,  octal  or
          hexadecimal number, optionally followed by the multipliers <STRONG>m</STRONG>, <STRONG>k</STRONG>,  <STRONG>w</STRONG>,
          and  <STRONG>b</STRONG>  for mega (1024*1024), kilo (1024), "word" (2 or 4), and byte
          (1).  Uppercase <STRONG>M</STRONG> is also accepted for  those  who  know  what  S.I.
          means.   The  compilers  use  <STRONG>-S</STRONG> <STRONG>32kw</STRONG> by default, that translates to
          64kb for an 8086, and 128kb for other architectures.  This option is
          ignored on a non-executable.
