     <STRONG>dhrystone</STRONG>           # Run the dhrystone benchmark

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>

     Many years ago, a floating-point benchmark called <EM>whetstone</EM>  was  popular
     for benchmarking FORTRAN programs.  Nowadays, an integer benchmark called
     <EM>dhrystone</EM> is widely used for benchmarking UNIX systems.  This is it.   Be
     warned,   however,  that  <EM>dhrystone</EM>  is  entirely  CPU  bound,  and  goes
     blindingly fast on machines with high-speed caches.  Although this  is  a
     good  measure  for  programs  that spend most of their time in some inner
     loop, it is a poor benchmark for I/O bound applications.
