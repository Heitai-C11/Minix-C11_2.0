<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>

     <EM>Su</EM> can be used to temporarily login as another user.  It prompts for  the
     superuser  password.   If  the  correct password is entered, <EM>su</EM> creates a
     shell with the desired uid.  If no name is specified,  <EM>root</EM>  is  assumed.
     To  exit  the  temporary shell, type CTRL-D.  When memory is tight, it is
     better to become superuser by logging out and then logging  in  again  as
     <EM>root</EM>,  rather  than  using  <EM>su</EM> since the latter creates an extra shell in
     memory.  Any user with a zero group id need not type  a  password.   This
     makes life easier for the system administrator.
