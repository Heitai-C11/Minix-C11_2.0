     elvis, ex, vi - The editor


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>elvis</STRONG> [<EM>flags</EM>] [<STRONG>+</STRONG><EM>cmd</EM>] [<EM>files</EM>...]


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Elvis</STRONG> is a text editor which emulates <STRONG>vi</STRONG>/<STRONG>ex</STRONG>.

     On systems which pass the program name as an argument, such as  Unix  and
     Minix, you may also install <STRONG>elvis</STRONG> under the names "ex", "vi", "view", and
     "input".  These extra names would normally be links  to  elvis;  see  the
     "ln" shell command.

     When <STRONG>elvis</STRONG> is invoked as "vi",  it  behaves  exactly  as  though  it  was
     invoked  as  "elvis".   However,  if you invoke <STRONG>elvis</STRONG> as "view", then the
     readonly option is set as though you had given it the "-R" flag.  If  you
     invoke  <STRONG>elvis</STRONG> as "ex", then <STRONG>elvis</STRONG> will start up in the colon command mode
     instead of the visual command mode, as though you had given it  the  "-e"
     flag.  If you invoke <STRONG>elvis</STRONG> as "input" or "edit", then <STRONG>elvis</STRONG> will start up
     in input mode, as though the "-i" flag was given.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>

     <STRONG>-r</STRONG>   To the real vi, this flag means  that  a  previous  edit  should  be
          recovered.  <STRONG>Elvis</STRONG>, though, has a separate program, called <STRONG><A HREF="../man1/elvrec.1.html">elvrec(1)</A></STRONG>,
          for recovering files.  When you invoke <STRONG>elvis</STRONG>  with  -r,  <STRONG>elvis</STRONG>  will
          tell you to run <STRONG>elvrec</STRONG>.

     <STRONG>-R</STRONG>   This sets the "readonly" option, so you won't accidentally overwrite
          a file.

     <STRONG>-t</STRONG> <EM>tag</EM>
          This causes <STRONG>elvis</STRONG> to start editing at the given tag.

     <STRONG>-m</STRONG> [<EM>file</EM>]
          <STRONG>Elvis</STRONG> will search through <EM>file</EM> for  something  that  looks  like  an
          error  message  from  a  compiler.   It  will then begin editing the
          source file that caused the error, with the cursor  sitting  on  the
          line  where  the error was detected.  If you don't explicitly name a
          <EM>file</EM>, then "errlist" is assumed.

     <STRONG>-e</STRONG>   <STRONG>Elvis</STRONG> will start up in colon command mode.

     <STRONG>-v</STRONG>   <STRONG>Elvis</STRONG> will start up in visual command mode.

     <STRONG>-i</STRONG>   <STRONG>Elvis</STRONG> will start up in input mode.



     <STRONG>-w</STRONG> <EM>winsize</EM>
          Sets the "window" option's value to <EM>winsize</EM>.

     <STRONG>+</STRONG><EM>command</EM> or <STRONG>-c</STRONG> <EM>command</EM>
          If you use the +<EM>command</EM> parameter, then  after  the  first  file  is
          loaded  <EM>command</EM>  is  executed  as  an EX command.  A typical example
          would be "elvis +237 foo", which would cause <STRONG>elvis</STRONG> to start  editing
          foo  and  then  move directly to line 237.  The "-c <EM>command</EM>" variant
          was added for UNIX SysV compatibility.

<H2>FILES</H2><PRE>

     /tmp/elv*
          During editing, <STRONG>elvis</STRONG> stores text in a temporary  file.   For  UNIX,
          this  file  will  usually  be  stored in the /tmp directory, and the
          first three characters  will  be  "elv".   For  other  systems,  the
          temporary  files  may  be  stored  someplace  else; see the version-
          specific section of the documentation.

     tags This is the database used by the <STRONG>:tags</STRONG> command and  the  <STRONG>-t</STRONG>  option.
          It is usually created by the <STRONG><A HREF="../man1/ctags.1.html">ctags(1)</A></STRONG> program.

     .exrc or elvis.rc
          On UNIX-like systems, a file called ".exrc" in your  home  directory
          is executed as a series of <STRONG>ex</STRONG> commands.  A file by the same name may
          be executed in the current directory,  too.   On  non-UNIX  systems,
          ".exrc"  is  usually an invalid file name; there, the initialization
          file is called "elvis.rc" instead.

</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     There is no LISP support.  Certain other features are missing, too.

     Auto-indent mode is not quite compatible with the real vi.   Among  other
     things, 0^D and ^^D don't do what you might expect.

     Long lines are displayed differently.  The real vi wraps long lines  onto
     multiple rows of the screen, but <STRONG>elvis</STRONG> scrolls sideways.

     Many other people have worked to port <STRONG>elvis</STRONG> to various operating systems.
     To  see  who deserves credit, run the <STRONG>:version</STRONG> command from within <STRONG>elvis</STRONG>,
     or look in the system-specific section of the complete documentation.
