<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>

     <EM>Fsck</EM> performs consistency checks on the file systems which reside on  the
     specified  devices.  <EM>Fsck1</EM> is an alternate version for use on obsolete V1
     file systems.  When either the <STRONG>-a</STRONG> or <STRONG>-r</STRONG> flags are given, the file  system
     will  be  repaired if errors are found.  Before running <EM>fsck</EM> on a mounted
     file system, it must first be unmounted.  Trying to repair a mounted file
     system is dangerous and should not be attempted.

     To repair the root file system (which cannot be  unmounted),  first  type
     CTRL-F9  at  the  console  to kill any and all processes.  Log back in as
     <STRONG>root</STRONG>, type <EM>sync</EM> to force any buffered changes to disk, run  <EM>fsck</EM>  on  the
     root file system and immediately reboot the computer by typing <EM>reboot</EM>.

     It is necessary to kill all processes  before  repairing  the  root  file
     system  to  prevent  them  from  modifying  any disk blocks while <EM>fsck</EM> is
     running.  This is only necessary for the root file system, any other file
     system can simply be unmounted before it is checked.
