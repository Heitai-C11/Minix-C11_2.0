     rarpd - reverse address resolution protocol daemon


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>rarpd</STRONG> [<STRONG>-d</STRONG>]


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Rarpd</STRONG> listens on the ethernet for broadcast packets  asking  for  reverse
     address resolution.  These packets are sent by hosts at boot time to find
     out their IP address.  <STRONG>Rarpd</STRONG> looks up the six octet  ethernet  number  in
     the <STRONG>/etc/ethers</STRONG> file finding a host name.  This name is translated to the
     IP address of the host by a DNS lookup.  The IP address is then  sent  to
     the host.

     Before <STRONG>rarpd</STRONG> can start its  service  it  first  finds  out  what  the  IP
     addresses  of the ethernets are.  It will look through <STRONG>/etc/ethers</STRONG> to map
     the ethernet addresses to host names.  It then uses <STRONG>/etc/hosts</STRONG> to map the
     host  names  to  IP  addresses.   If  this lookup fails then several RARP
     requests are broadcasted in the hope that  some  RARP  server  knows  the
     addresses.   The  IP  addresses  are  eventually  set  in the same way as
     <STRONG><A HREF="../man8/ifconfig.8.html">ifconfig(8)</A></STRONG>.  (The address is not changed if already set with  <STRONG>ifconfig</STRONG>.)
     Note  that  the  host  names  in  the  ethers  and hosts files must match
     exactly.  The DNS can not  be  used  yet,  so  a  simple  name  can't  be
     translated to a fully qualified name.

     <STRONG>Rarpd</STRONG> exits after startup if there are no active ethernets, or  if  there
     is no ethers file.

     <STRONG>Warning!</STRONG> Sun diskless workstations assume that the first RARP server that
     answers  is  the  host they are to boot from.  For this to work all other
     Sun RARP servers delay their answer if they are not also  the  requestors
     boot  server.   The  Minix  <STRONG>rarpd</STRONG>  does  not  have this kludge so it will
     happily engage the Sun boot server to  see  who  can  answer  the  client
     first.   Unless your Minix host can actually serve a Sun diskless client,
     it is better not  to  list  any  more  hosts  in  the  ethers  file  than
     necessary.
