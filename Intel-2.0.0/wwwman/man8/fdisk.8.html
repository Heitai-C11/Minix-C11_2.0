<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     fdisk - partition a hard disk [IBM]


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>fdisk</STRONG> [<STRONG>-h</STRONG><EM>m</EM>] [<STRONG>-s</STRONG><EM>n</EM>] [<EM>file</EM>]


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>

     <STRONG>-h</STRONG>   Number of disk heads is <EM>m</EM>

     <STRONG>-s</STRONG>   Number of sectors per track is <EM>n</EM>


</PRE>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2><PRE>

     <STRONG>fdisk</STRONG> <STRONG>/dev/hd0</STRONG>      # Examine disk partitions

     <STRONG>fdisk</STRONG> <STRONG>-h9</STRONG> <STRONG>/dev/hd0</STRONG>  # Examine disk with 9 heads

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>

     When <EM>fdisk</EM> starts up, it reads in the partition table  and  displays  it.
     It then presents a menu to allow the user to modify partitions, store the
     partition table on a file, or load it from a  file.   Partitions  can  be
     marked  as MINIX, DOS or other, as well as active or not.  Using <EM>fdisk</EM> is
     self-explanatory. However, be aware that repartitioning a disk will cause
     information  on  it  to  be  lost.  Rebooting  the  system <EM>immediately</EM> is
     mandatory after changing partition sizes and parameters.   MINIX,  XENIX,
     PC-IX,  and  MS-DOS all have different partition numbering schemes.  Thus
     when using multiple systems on the same disk, be careful.

     Note that MINIX, unlike MS-DOS , cannot  access  the  last  sector  in  a
     partition  with  an odd number of sectors.  The reason that odd partition
     sizes do not cause a problem with MS-DOS is that  MS-DOS  allocates  disk
     space  in units of 512-byte sectors, whereas MINIX uses 1K blocks.  <EM>Fdisk</EM>
     has a variety of other features that can be seen by typing <EM>h</EM>.

     <EM>Fdisk</EM> normally knows the geometry of the device  by  asking  the  driver.
     You can use the <STRONG>-h</STRONG> and <STRONG>-s</STRONG> options to override the numbers found.
