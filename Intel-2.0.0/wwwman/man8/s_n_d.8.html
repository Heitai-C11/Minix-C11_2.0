<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     s_n_d, set_net_default - select the default TCP/IP network


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>set_net_default:</STRONG> <STRONG>not</STRONG> <STRONG>found</STRONG>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     This manual page is here  because  so  many  others  refer  to  it.   The
     <STRONG>set_net_default</STRONG>  command does not exist under standard Minix, because the
     TCP/IP server only supports one  network.   The  server  under  Minix-vmd
     supports  four different networks, that can each be chosen as the default
     network.

     The TCP/IP library and  commands  do  have  a  notion  about  a  "default
     network"  however, because the code is shared between the Minix versions.
     So if you want to venture into network programming then you  should  know
     about  the devices and environment variables mentioned below to make your
     program compatible.  (Especially since there is a  plan  to  upgrade  the
     TCP/IP server for standard Minix.)

  <STRONG>Options</STRONG> <STRONG>and</STRONG> <STRONG>environment</STRONG> <STRONG>to</STRONG> <STRONG>change</STRONG> <STRONG>the</STRONG> <STRONG>default</STRONG>
     Many TCP/IP programs implement  the  following  options  and  environment
     variables  to  change  the  default  devices set by <STRONG>set_net_default</STRONG>.  The
     options are only implemented for low level programs where it makes  sense
     to  name  a  network  device.   The environment variables are used in all
     code.  You can run  a  process  and  all  its  children  connected  to  a
     different network by setting four environment variables.

     <STRONG>ETH_DEVICE=</STRONG><EM>device</EM>
     <STRONG>-E</STRONG> <EM>device</EM>
          Device to  use  as  raw  ethernet  device  instead  of  the  default
          /dev/eth.

     <STRONG>PSIP_DEVICE=</STRONG><EM>device</EM>
     <STRONG>-P</STRONG> <EM>device</EM>
          Pseudo IP device to use instead of /dev/psip.

     <STRONG>IP_DEVICE=</STRONG><EM>device</EM>
     <STRONG>-I</STRONG> <EM>device</EM>
          IP device to use instead of /dev/ip.

     <STRONG>TCP_DEVICE=</STRONG><EM>device</EM>
     <STRONG>-T</STRONG> <EM>device</EM>
          TCP device to use.

     <STRONG>UDP_DEVICE=</STRONG><EM>device</EM>
     <STRONG>-U</STRONG> <EM>device</EM>
          UDP device to use.

<H2>FILES</H2><PRE>

     /dev/eth[01]      First and second raw ethernet.

     /dev/psip[01]     First and second Pseudo IP network.

     /dev/ip[0123]     IP  devices  for  two  ethernets  and  two  Pseudo   IP
                       networks.

     /dev/tcp[0123]    TCP devices for same four networks.

     /dev/udp[0123]    UDP devices.

     /dev/eth, /dev/psip, /dev/ip, /dev/tcp, /dev/udp
                       Devices for the default network, links to  the  devices
                       above.  <STRONG>Eth</STRONG> is only present if ethernet is the default,
                       <STRONG>psip</STRONG> only for pseudo IP.
