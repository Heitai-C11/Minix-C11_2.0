     init - grandparent of all processes


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The first program started by Minix is <STRONG>init</STRONG>.   The  actions  performed  by
     <STRONG>init</STRONG> can be summarized by this pseudo shell program:

          # Open 0, 1, 2.
          exec &lt;/dev/null &gt;/dev/log 2&gt;&amp;1

          # Run the system initialization script.
          sh /etc/rc $bootopts

          &gt;/etc/utmp
          echo reboot &gt;&gt;/usr/adm/wtmp

          while :; do
                  # Wait for a process to exit, but don't always block.
                  wait

                  # Record logout.  (Not in this dumb way, of course.)
                  if "pid is in my tables" $pid
                  then
                          echo "logout $pid" &gt;/etc/utmp
                          echo "logout $pid" &gt;&gt;/usr/adm/wtmp
                  fi

                  # Start a new session.
                  while read line type getty init
                  do
                          if idle $line
                          then
                                  $init ... &lt;$tty &gt;$tty
                                  $getty &lt;$tty &gt;$tty 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;
                                  pid=$!
                                  "add pid to tables" $pid
                                  echo "login $line $pid" &gt;/etc/utmp
                                  echo "login $line $pid" &gt;&gt;/usr/adm/wtmp
                          fi
                  done &lt; /dev/ttytab
          done

     The first action of <STRONG>init</STRONG> is to run <STRONG>/etc/rc</STRONG> to initialize  the  system  as
     described  in <STRONG><A HREF="../man8/boot.8.html">boot(8)</A></STRONG>.  <STRONG>Init</STRONG> then enters its main loop where it waits for
     processes to exit, and starts processes on each  enabled  terminal  line.
     The  file <STRONG>/etc/ttytab</STRONG> contains a list of terminal devices, their terminal
     types, the program to execute on them to  allow  one  to  login  (usually
     <STRONG><A HREF="../man8/getty.8.html">getty(8)</A></STRONG>),  and  the  program  to  execute  first  to initialize the line
     (usually <STRONG><A HREF="../man1/stty.1.html">stty(1)</A></STRONG>).  These fields may be left out to indicate that a  line
     is  disabled  or  that initialization is not necessary.  The commands are
     searched using the path <STRONG>/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin</STRONG>.

     <STRONG>Init</STRONG> accepts several signals that must be sent to process id 1.   (It  is
     the first process, so natually its process id is 1.)  The signals are:

     <STRONG>SIGHUP</STRONG>
          When receiving a hangup signal, <STRONG>init</STRONG> will forget  about  errors  and
          rescan  <STRONG>ttytab</STRONG>  for  processes  to  execute.   <STRONG>Init</STRONG> normally rescans
          <STRONG>ttytab</STRONG> each time it feels the need to  respawn  a  process,  so  the
          hangup  signal is only needed if a line has been shut down, or after
          a terminate signal.  Note that after turning a  line  off  you  will
          have to kill the process running on that line manually, <STRONG>init</STRONG> doesn't
          do that for you.

     <STRONG>SIGTERM</STRONG>
          Normally sent by programs that halt or reboot Minix.  Causes <STRONG>init</STRONG> to
          stop spawning new processes.

     <STRONG>SIGABRT</STRONG>
          Sent by the keyboard driver when the <STRONG>CTRL</STRONG>-<STRONG>ALT</STRONG>-<STRONG>DEL</STRONG> key combination is
          typed.   Causes  <STRONG>init</STRONG>  to  run the <STRONG>shutdown</STRONG> command.  A second abort
          signal makes <STRONG>init</STRONG> halt the system directly with a system call.   The
          keyboard  driver  halts  the system, without a sync, after the third
          CTRL-ALT-DEL.

  <STRONG>Minix</STRONG> <STRONG>vs.</STRONG> <STRONG>Minix</STRONG>-<STRONG>vmd</STRONG>
     There are a few differences between standard Minix and Minix-vmd  on  how
     <STRONG>init</STRONG>  is  run.   The  <STRONG>/etc/rc</STRONG>  file is executed under standard Minix with
     input connected to  <STRONG>/dev/console</STRONG>,  but  under  Minix-vmd  this  is  still
     <STRONG>/dev/null</STRONG>.  This means that under Minix-vmd processes must be reconnected
     to <STRONG>/dev/console</STRONG> with the <STRONG>intr</STRONG> program  if  they  need  user  interaction.
     Minix-vmd  passes  the  value  of  the <STRONG>bootopts</STRONG> boot variable to /etc/rc.
     Standard Minix does not.
