<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Fingerd</STRONG> is a simple protocol based on RFC742 that provides  an  interface
     to the Name and Finger programs at several network sites.  The program is
     supposed to return a friendly, human-oriented status report on either the
     system  at  the  moment  or  a  particular  person in depth.  There is no
     required format and the protocol consists mostly of specifying  a  single
     ``command line''.

     <STRONG>Fingerd</STRONG> listens for TCP requests at port 79.  Once connected it  reads  a
     single  command line terminated by a &lt;CRLF&gt; which is passed to <STRONG><A HREF="../man1/finger.1.html">finger(1)</A></STRONG>.
     <STRONG>Fingerd</STRONG> closes its connections as soon as the output is finished.

     If the line is null (i.e. just a &lt;CRLF&gt; is sent) then  <STRONG>finger</STRONG>  returns  a
     ``default''  report  that lists all people logged into the system at that
     moment.

     If a user name is specified (e.g. eric&lt;CRLF&gt;)  then  the  response  lists
     more  extended  information for only that particular user, whether logged
     in or not.  Allowable ``names'' in the command line include both  ``login
     names''  and  ``user  names''.   If  a  name  is  ambiguous, all possible
     derivations are returned.

<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     Connecting directly to the server from a TIP or an equally  narrow-minded
     TELNET-protocol user program can result in meaningless attempts at option
     negotiation being sent to the server, which will foul up the command line
     interpretation.  <STRONG>Fingerd</STRONG> should be taught to filter out IAC's and perhaps
     even respond negatively (IAC WON'T) to all option commands received.
