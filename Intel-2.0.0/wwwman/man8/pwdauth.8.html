     pwdauth - password authentication program


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>/usr/lib/pwdauth</STRONG>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Pwdauth</STRONG> is a program that is used by the <STRONG><A HREF="../man3/crypt.3.html">crypt(3)</A></STRONG> function to do the hard
     work.   It is a setuid root utility so that it is able to read the shadow
     password file.

     <STRONG>Pwdauth</STRONG> expects on  standard  input  two  null  terminated  strings,  the
     password  typed by the user, and the salt.  That is, the two arguments of
     the <STRONG>crypt</STRONG> function.  The input read in a single read call  must  be  1024
     characters or less including the nulls.  <STRONG>Pwdauth</STRONG> takes one of two actions
     depending on the salt.

     If the salt has the form "<STRONG>##</STRONG><EM>user</EM>" then the <EM>user</EM>  is  used  to  index  the
     shadow  password  file  to  obtain  the  encrypted  password.   The input
     password is encrypted with  the  one-way  encryption  function  contained
     within  <STRONG>pwdauth</STRONG>  and  compared  to the encrypted password from the shadow
     password file.  If equal then <STRONG>pwdauth</STRONG> returns the  string  "<STRONG>##</STRONG><EM>user</EM>"  with
     exit  code  0,  otherwise  exit  code  2  to  signal failure.  The string
     "<STRONG>##</STRONG><EM>user</EM>" is also returned if both  the  shadow  password  and  the  input
     password are null strings to allow a password-less login.

     If the salt is not of the form "<STRONG>##</STRONG><EM>user</EM>" then the  password  is  encrypted
     and  the  result of the encryption is returned.  If salt and password are
     null strings then a null string is returned.

     The return value is written to  standard  output  as  a  null  terminated
     string of 1024 characters or less including the null.

     The exit code is 1 on any error.

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
     A password must be checked like in this example:

          pw_ok = (strcmp(crypt(key, pw-&gt;pw_passwd), pw-&gt;pw_passwd) == 0);

     The second argument of crypt must be the entire  encrypted  password  and
     not just the two character salt.
