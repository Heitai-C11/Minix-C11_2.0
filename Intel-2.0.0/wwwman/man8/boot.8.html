<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     boot - from power on to the login prompt


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     At power on the machine reads the first sector of the  boot  device  into
     memory  and executes it.  This bootstrap code loads <STRONG>/boot</STRONG>, the Minix Boot
     Monitor.  The monitor loads the  kernel  binaries  from  <STRONG>/minix</STRONG>,  or  the
     newest file in <STRONG>/minix</STRONG> if it is a directory.

     The  Minix  system  is  now  running,  the  different  tasks   initialize
     themselves and control is transferred to the last one, <STRONG>init</STRONG>.

     <STRONG>Init</STRONG> is the grandparent of all Minix processes,  it  is  responsible  for
     starting login processes on each terminal, but first it runs <STRONG>/etc/rc</STRONG>.

     <STRONG>/etc/rc</STRONG> checks the state of the system and starts daemons.  First it sets
     the  keyboard  translation to the mapping in <STRONG>/etc/keymap</STRONG> if present, then
     it reads  the  time  zone  from  <STRONG>/etc/timeinfo</STRONG>  followed  by  a  call  to
     <STRONG><A HREF="../man8/readclock.8.html">readclock(8)</A></STRONG>  to  set  Minix time from the hardware clock.  Next the file
     systems are checked if necessary and the <STRONG>/usr</STRONG> file system is mounted.

     The system is  now  ready  for  multiuser  startup,  <STRONG>/etc/rc</STRONG>  starts  the
     <STRONG><A HREF="../man8/update.8.html">update(8)</A></STRONG>  and  <STRONG><A HREF="../man8/cron.8.html">cron(8)</A></STRONG>  daemons,  and  initializes the network services.
     <STRONG>/etc/rc</STRONG> finally recovers crashed editor buffers and cleans  out  the  <STRONG>tmp</STRONG>
     directories.

     <STRONG>Init</STRONG> reads <STRONG>/etc/ttytab</STRONG> and starts a <STRONG><A HREF="../man8/getty.8.html">getty(8)</A></STRONG> for  each  enabled  terminal
     line to allow a user to log in.

<H2>BOOT ENVIRONMENT</H2><PRE>
     Many features of the drivers inside the kernel are controlled by settings
     in the boot environment.  The values of these variables are usually colon
     or comma separated numbers configuring the driver.  <STRONG>DPETH0</STRONG> <STRONG>=</STRONG> <STRONG>300:10</STRONG> tells
     the  ethernet  driver to use I/O address 0x300, interrupt request 10, and
     the default memory address (0xD0000, values may be omitted) for the first
     ethernet  board.   (Note  that  IRQ  2 is redirected to IRQ 9 on AT's and
     PS/2's, so use 9 if a device is jumpered for 2.)

     Variables that are special  to  both  the  monitor  and  the  kernel  are
     described  in <STRONG><A HREF="../man8/monitor.8.html">monitor(8)</A></STRONG>.  This section lists extra variables or variable
     settings:

     <STRONG>hd</STRONG> = <STRONG>at</STRONG> | <STRONG>bios</STRONG> | <STRONG>esdi</STRONG> | <STRONG>xt</STRONG>
          Choose the driver that is to be used for the hard  disk,  in  order:
          IBM/AT  (classic AT or newer IDE), BIOS (generic driver), ESDI (some
          PS/2's), or IBM/XT.  By default the first of these drivers  that  is
          enabled  is  used.   Most  drivers  are  present  in  the  kernel as
          distributed,    but    may    be    taken    out    by     modifying
          <STRONG>/usr/include/minix/config.h</STRONG>.   (An  XT  should  always  use the BIOS
          driver, not the XT driver, because BIOS calls are cheap  on  an  XT.
          The XT driver can be used on AT machines with an old XT controller.)

     <STRONG>DPETH</STRONG><EM>n</EM> = <STRONG>on</STRONG> | <STRONG>off</STRONG>
          Turn an ethernet board on or off.   The  driver  is  by  default  in
          "sink"  mode  for  all  boards.  The sink mode allows one to use the
          driver without an ethernet board installed.  The  driver  will  play
          /dev/null  for that device, i.e. nothing comes in, and anything send
          out is dropped on the floor.  If the board is  turned  on  then  the
          driver will use it to send out packets, if it is turned off then the
          driver will fail for that board.

     <STRONG>DPETH</STRONG><EM>n</EM> = <EM>I</EM>/<EM>O</EM>-<EM>addr</EM>:<EM>irq</EM>:<EM>mem</EM>_<EM>addr</EM>
          Set the I/O address (hex), IRQ (decimal) and memory address (hex) of
          the  <EM>n</EM>-th  ethernet  board  and  turn  it  on.   By default they are
          configured as 280:3:D0000 and 300:5:CC000.  The  memory  address  is
          ignored for the Novell ethernet boards, but may be explicitly set to
          zero to indicate that the board <STRONG>is</STRONG> a Novell ethernet board.  You  do
          not  need  to  specify  the  IRQ  with  modern  Western Digital 8013
          compatible ethernet cards, the driver asks the board  what  its  IRQ
          is.   (Note  that  the  default IRQ conflicts with the second serial
          line, so the serial line is turned off  if  the  ethernet  board  is
          configured for IRQ 3.)

     <STRONG>DPETH</STRONG><EM>n</EM><STRONG>_EA</STRONG> = <EM>e0</EM>:<EM>e1</EM>:<EM>e2</EM>:<EM>e3</EM>:<EM>e4</EM>:<EM>e5</EM>
          Set the ethernet address of the <EM>n</EM>-th ethernet board.  The address is
          normally  obtained  from  the ethernet board, so only in exceptional
          circumstances is this setting ever needed.  (Use the address of  the
          main server if you want a career change.)

     <STRONG>AHA0</STRONG> = <EM>I</EM>/<EM>O</EM>-<EM>addr</EM>:<EM>bus</EM>-<EM>on</EM>:<EM>bus</EM>-<EM>off</EM>:<EM>tr</EM>-<EM>speed</EM>
          Configure the Adaptec 154xA SCSI host adapter to use the  given  I/O
          address  (hex),  Bus-on  time  (decimal), Bus-off time (decimal) and
          transfer speed (hex).  The  default  is  330:15:1:00.   The  default
          transfer  speed  is  always  5.0  Mb/s (code 00) ignoring the jumper
          settings.

     <STRONG>sd</STRONG><EM>n</EM> = <EM>target</EM>,<EM>lun</EM>
          Program SCSI disk <STRONG>sd</STRONG><EM>n</EM> to have the  given  target  and  logical  unit
          number.   The  target  and lun of a tape or other SCSI device may be
          changed by setting the <STRONG>sd</STRONG><EM>n</EM> variable that would be used had it been a
          disk.   So  tape  device  st7  can  be  set  to target 4, lun 1 with
          sd35=4,1.

     <STRONG>MCD</STRONG> = <EM>I</EM>/<EM>O</EM>-<EM>addr</EM>:<EM>irq</EM>
          I/O address (hex) and IRQ (decimal) of the Mitsumi CD-ROM driver, by
          default 300:10.





</PRE>
<H2>TCP/IP CONFIGURATION</H2><PRE>
     To use TCP/IP you have to compile a kernel with networking  enabled,  and
     unless you are running standalone you have to enable the ethernet driver.
     See the <STRONG>DPETH</STRONG><EM>n</EM> boot variable above.  The driver supports  these  ethernet
     cards:   Western  Digital 8003, Western Digital 8013, SMC Elite Ultra 16,
     Novell NE1000, Novell NE2000.  Many newer variants  of  the  WD8013,  now
     under the SMC brand, are also supported.

     You are likely to use TCP/IP in one of three situations:

          Standalone with no connection to a network.

          In a small network with no support from a "big" host.

          Connected to a large network with address and name servers.

     In each situation you need a different set of configuration files.

  <STRONG>Standalone</STRONG>
     The machine is configured with a fixed IP address:  <STRONG>192.9.200.1</STRONG>.  This is
     one  of  the  addresses Sun used to give to machines without a registered
     network address.  This address is normally blocked at gateways, so it can
     do  no  damage  if  used  in  a real net by accident.  You need one file,
     <STRONG>/etc/hosts</STRONG>, that should look like this (using the  name  "darask"  as  an
     example):

          127.0.0.1      localhost
          192.9.200.1    darask

  <STRONG>Small</STRONG> <STRONG>Network</STRONG>
     In a network where the Minix machine can't obtain its IP address and name
     from  a different host you need specify the ethernet address to host name
     translation in the <STRONG>/etc/ethers</STRONG> file for use by the RARP daemon.   Suppose
     you  have  two  machines in your network then <STRONG>/etc/ethers</STRONG> could look like
     this:

          0:0:c0:a:77:23      darask
          0:0:c0:a:68:ce      burask

     Use <STRONG>hostaddr</STRONG> <STRONG>-e</STRONG> to find out what the six octet ethernet address of a host
     is.   Use the address as printed: lowercase hex digits, no leading zeros.
     The <STRONG>/etc/hosts</STRONG> file shows their IP addresses:

          127.0.0.1      localhost
          192.9.200.1    darask
          192.9.200.2    burask




     <STRONG>Warning!</STRONG> Do not add ethernet addresses of diskless workstations  to  your
     ethers file.  A Sun for instance has the stupid habit of booting from the
     first RARP server that answers, probably your Minix machine...

  <STRONG>Large</STRONG> <STRONG>Network</STRONG>
     In a network with a central  network  administration  your  machine's  IP
     address  and  name are given by the RARP and name services of the special
     servers on the network.  For a new machine you need to apply  for  an  IP
     address  and  host  name  with  your  network administrator supplying the
     ethernet address of your machine.  You don't need any configuration files
     now, the <STRONG>irdpd</STRONG> and <STRONG>nonamed</STRONG> daemons automatically find a router and a name
     server.

     Note that no knowledge of the IP address or hostname of the Minix machine
     itself  is  necessary,  it  all  comes from the RARP and name servers.  A
     series of Minix machines can therefore set up identically.  Even  if  you
     have no RARP or name servers you can still set them up identically if you
     list all the Minix hosts in the hosts and ethers files.

  <STRONG>Simpler</STRONG> <STRONG>configuration</STRONG> <STRONG>tools</STRONG>
     The <STRONG>rarpd</STRONG>, <STRONG>irdpd</STRONG> and <STRONG>nonamed</STRONG> daemons are complex little programs that try
     to  obtain information about their surroundings automatically to tell the
     machine what its place in the network is.  It should come as no  surprise
     that  there  are  simpler  utilities to configure a machine.  On a memory
     starved machine it may even be wise to configure a machine statically  to
     get rid of the daemons.  The first daemon, <STRONG>rarpd</STRONG>, can be replaced by:

          <STRONG>ifconfig</STRONG> <STRONG>-h</STRONG> <EM>host</EM>-<EM>IP</EM>-<EM>address</EM>

     to set the IP address of the machine.  Note that this is  only  necessary
     if  there  is  no  external RARP service.  The second daemon <STRONG>irdpd</STRONG> can be
     replaced by setting a static route:

          <STRONG>add_route</STRONG> <STRONG>-g</STRONG> <EM>router</EM>-<EM>IP</EM>-<EM>address</EM>

     (if there is a router.)  The last daemon, <STRONG>nonamed</STRONG>, can be replaced by  an
     entry in <STRONG>/etc/resolv.conf</STRONG> that specifies an external name daemon:

          <STRONG>nameserver</STRONG> <EM>nameserver</EM>-<EM>IP</EM>-<EM>address</EM>

     The <STRONG>ifconfig</STRONG> and <STRONG>add_route</STRONG> calls can be placed in the  file  <STRONG>/etc/rc.net</STRONG>.
     The  calls  to  the  daemons will have to be edited out of <STRONG>/etc/rc</STRONG>.  Note
     that  these  changes  undo  all  the  efforts  to   make   Minix   TCP/IP
     autoconfigurable.   Make very sure that all the IP addresses are correct,
     and that the IP address of your machine is unique.  (Mistakenly using the
     address  of  a  main  server  will  make  all other machines look at your
     machine, and will make all the users of all other machines look at you.)

<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2><PRE>

     Checking File Systems.
          If the system has crashed then <STRONG>fsck</STRONG> is called for the root and  /usr
          file  systems.  It is wise to reboot if the root file system must be
          fixed.

     Finish the name of device to mount as /usr: /dev/
          If the name of the /usr file system has not been set in  /etc/fstab.
          You can type a device name, say <STRONG>fd0</STRONG>.

     hostaddr: unable to fetch IP address
          TCP/IP misconfiguration.  The  RARP  may  have  failed  because  the
          ethernet  address of the machine is not entered in either the remote
          or  the  local  ethers  file.    Either   talk   to   your   Network
          Administrator, or make an ethers and a hosts file.

     1.2.3.4 login:
          If you see an IP address instead of a  host  name  then  the  system
          failed  to  translate  the  IP address.  Either talk to your Network
          Administrator to have the reverse address translation tables  fixed,
          or make a hosts file.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
     The names "darask" and "burask"  are  names  of  cities  from  the  Dutch
     translation  of  the  novel  "The  Many-Colored Land" by Julian May.  The
     author of this text likes names  of  hosts  to  be  things  that  contain
     people, like cities and ships.






</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     Indefinite hangs are possible if I/O addresses or  IRQ's  are  wrong.   A
     driver  may babble about addresses and IRQ's, but that does not mean that
     what it says is true, it may just be configured that  way.   It  is  very
     difficult  to  find  peripherals on a PC automatically, and Minix doesn't
     even try.
