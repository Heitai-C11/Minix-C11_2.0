     elvprsv - Preserve the the modified version of a file after a crash.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>

     <EM>elvprsv</EM> preserves your edited text after <EM>elvis</EM> dies.   The  text  can  be
     recovered later, via the <EM>elvprsv</EM> program.

     For UNIX-like systems, you should never need to run this program from the
     command line.  It is run automatically when <EM>elvis</EM> is about to die, and it
     should be run (via /etc/rc) when the computer is booted.  THAT'S ALL!

     For non-UNIX systems such as MS-DOS, you can either use <EM>elvprsv</EM> the  same
     way as under UNIX systems (by running it from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file), or
     you can run it separately with the "-R" flag to recover the files in  one
     step.

     If you're editing a file when <EM>elvis</EM> dies (due to  a  bug,  system  crash,
     power  failure, etc.)  then <EM>elvprsv</EM> will preserve the most recent version
     of your text.  The preserved text is stored in a  special  directory;  it
     does NOT overwrite your text file automatically.

     <EM>elvprsv</EM> will send mail to any user  whose  work  it  preserves,  if  your
     operating system normally supports mail.

<H2>FILES</H2><PRE>

     /tmp/elv*
          The temporary file that <EM>elvis</EM> was using when it died.

     /usr/preserve/p*
          The text that is preserved by <EM>elvprsv</EM>.

     /usr/preserve/Index
          A text file which lists the names of all preserved  files,  and  the
          names  of  the  /usr/preserve/p* files which contain their preserved
          text.


</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>

     Due to the permissions on the /usr/preserve directory,  on  UNIX  systems
     <EM>elvprsv</EM>  must  be  run  as superuser.  This is accomplished by making the
     <EM>elvprsv</EM> executable be owned by "root" and turning on its  "set  user  id"
     bit.


     If you're editing a nameless buffer when <EM>elvis</EM> dies,  then  <EM>elvprsv</EM>  will
     pretend that the file was named "foo".
