<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     fstab, mtab - list of file systems to mount, mounted file system table.

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>/etc/fstab</STRONG>

     <STRONG>/etc/mtab</STRONG>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>/etc/fstab</STRONG> is a table of file system to mount at boot time, <STRONG>/etc/mtab</STRONG>  is
     a  table  of  currently  mounted  file systems as maintained by <STRONG>mount</STRONG> and
     <STRONG>umount</STRONG>.

     <STRONG>/etc/fstab</STRONG> is not read by <STRONG>mount</STRONG> as it should be.  It is instead a  simple
     shell  script listing the three devices that Minix needs to operate:  The
     device names of the  root  file  system,  the  temporary  (scratch)  file
     system, and the file system for <STRONG>/usr</STRONG>.  Of these only the /usr file system
     is mounted in <STRONG>/etc/rc</STRONG>, the scratch file system is there  for  the  system
     administrator to test new kernels, or as a temporary file system.

     <STRONG>/etc/mtab</STRONG> contains lines of four fields.  The layout is:

          <STRONG>device</STRONG>    <STRONG>directory</STRONG>    <STRONG>type</STRONG>    <STRONG>options</STRONG>

     These fields may be explained as follows:

     <STRONG>device</STRONG>
          A block special device.

     <STRONG>directory</STRONG>
          Mount point.

     <STRONG>type</STRONG>
          Either <STRONG>1</STRONG>, or <STRONG>2</STRONG>, indicating a V1 or V2 file system.

     <STRONG>options</STRONG>
          Either <STRONG>ro</STRONG>, or <STRONG>rw</STRONG>, indicating a read-only or read-write mounted  file
          system.
