<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     setuid, setgid - set user or group ID's


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</STRONG>

     <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>setuid(uid_t</STRONG> <EM>uid</EM><STRONG>)</STRONG>
     <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>setgid(gid_t</STRONG> <EM>gid</EM><STRONG>)</STRONG>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Setuid</STRONG> sets the real and effective user ID's of the  current  process  to
     <EM>uid</EM>.   Unprivileged users may only change both user ID's to the real user
     ID; only the super-user may make other changes.  <STRONG>Setgid</STRONG> does the same for
     the real and effective group ID's.

     Minix-vmd allows an unprivileged user to change ID's to the original real
     or  effective  ID  as  they  were  at  the time the process was executed.
     <STRONG>Setgid</STRONG> may also set the group ID's to any of the additional  group  ID's.
     If one of the remembered user ID's was 0 then any user or group ID may be
     chosen.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and <STRONG>errno</STRONG> is set to indicate the error.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>

     [EPERM]        The current process is not the  super-user  and  a  change
                    other than one of the allowed changes was attempted.
