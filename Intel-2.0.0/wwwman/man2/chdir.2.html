<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     chdir - change current working directory


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</STRONG>

     <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>chdir(const</STRONG> <STRONG>char</STRONG> <STRONG>*</STRONG><EM>path</EM><STRONG>)</STRONG>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <EM>Path</EM> is the pathname of a directory.   <STRONG>Chdir</STRONG>  causes  this  directory  to
     become  the  current working directory, the starting point for path names
     not beginning with ``/''.

     In order for a directory to become the current directory, a process  must
     have execute (search) access to the directory.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and <STRONG>errno</STRONG> is set to indicate the error.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Chdir</STRONG> will fail and the current working directory will  be  unchanged  if
     one or more of the following are true:

     [ENOTDIR]      A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

     [ENAMETOOLONG] The path name exceeds PATH_MAX characters.

     [ENOENT]       The named directory does not exist.

     [ELOOP]        Too many symbolic links were  encountered  in  translating
                    the pathname.  (Minix-vmd)

     [EACCES]       Search permission is denied for any component of the  path
                    name.

     [EFAULT]       <EM>Path</EM> points outside the process's allocated address space.

     [EIO]          An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
                    file system.
