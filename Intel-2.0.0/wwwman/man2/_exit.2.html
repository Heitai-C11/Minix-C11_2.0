<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     exit, _exit - terminate a process


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>void</STRONG> <STRONG>_exit(int</STRONG> <EM>status</EM><STRONG>)</STRONG>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>_exit</STRONG> terminates a process with the following consequences:

          All of the descriptors open in the calling process are closed.  This
          may  entail  delays,  for  example,  waiting  for output to drain; a
          process in this state may not be killed, as it is already dying.

          If the parent process of the calling process is executing a <STRONG>wait</STRONG>  or
          is interested in the SIGCHLD signal (Minix-vmd), then it is notified
          of the calling process's termination and the low-order eight bits of
          <EM>status</EM> are made available to it; see <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/wait.2.html">wait(2)</A></STRONG>.

          The parent process ID of all of the calling process's existing child
          processes  are  also  set  to 1.  This means that the initialization
          process (see <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/intro.2.html">intro(2)</A></STRONG>) inherits each of these processes as well.

     Most C programs call the library routine <STRONG><A HREF="../man3/exit.3.html">exit(3)</A></STRONG>, which performs  cleanup
     actions in the standard I/O library before calling _<EM>exit</EM>.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
     This call never returns.
