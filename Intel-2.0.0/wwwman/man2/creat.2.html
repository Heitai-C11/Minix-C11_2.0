     creat - create a new file

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</STRONG>
     <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</STRONG>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>This</STRONG> <STRONG>interface</STRONG> <STRONG>is</STRONG> <STRONG>made</STRONG> <STRONG>obsolete</STRONG> <STRONG>by</STRONG> <STRONG>open(2),</STRONG> <STRONG>it</STRONG> <STRONG>is</STRONG> <STRONG>equivalent</STRONG> <STRONG>to</STRONG>

          open(<EM>name</EM>, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, <EM>mode</EM>)

     <STRONG>Creat</STRONG> creates a new file or prepares to rewrite an existing  file  called
     <EM>name</EM>,  given as the address of a null-terminated string.  If the file did
     not exist, it is given mode <EM>mode</EM>, as modified by the process's mode  mask
     (see  <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/umask.2.html">umask(2)</A></STRONG>).   Also  see  <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/chmod.2.html">chmod(2)</A></STRONG>  for  the construction of the <EM>mode</EM>
     argument.

     If the file did exist, its mode and owner  remain  unchanged  but  it  is
     truncated to 0 length.

     The file is also opened for writing, and its file descriptor is returned.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
     The <EM>mode</EM> given is arbitrary; it need not allow writing.  This feature has
     been  used  in  the  past  by  programs  to construct a simple, exclusive
     locking mechanism.  It is replaced  by  the  O_EXCL  open  mode,  or  the
     advisory locking of the <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</A></STRONG> facility.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
     The value -1 is returned if an error occurs.  Otherwise, the call returns
     a non-negative descriptor that only permits writing.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
     <EM>Creat</EM> will fail and the file will not be created or truncated if  one  of
     the following occur:

     [ENOTDIR]      A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

     [ENAMETOOLONG] The path name exceeds PATH_MAX characters.

     [ENOENT]       The named file does not exist.

     [ELOOP]        Too many symbolic links were  encountered  in  translating
                    the pathname.  (Minix-vmd)



     [EACCES]       Search permission is denied for a component  of  the  path
                    prefix.

     [EACCES]       The file does not exist and the directory in which  it  is
                    to be created is not writable.

     [EACCES]       The file exists, but it is unwritable.

     [EISDIR]       The file is a directory.

     [EMFILE]       There are already too many files open.

     [ENFILE]       The system file table is full.

     [ENOSPC]       The directory in which the entry for the new file is being
                    placed  cannot  be extended because there is no space left
                    on the file system containing the directory.

     [ENOSPC]       There are no free inodes on the file system on  which  the
                    file is being created.

     [EROFS]        The named file resides on a read-only file system.

     [ENXIO]        The file is a character special or block special file, and
                    the associated device does not exist.

     [EIO]          An I/O error occurred while making the directory entry  or
                    allocating the inode.

     [EFAULT]       <EM>Name</EM> points outside the process's allocated address space.
