     <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>fcntl(int</STRONG> <EM>fd</EM><STRONG>,</STRONG> <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>*</STRONG><EM>cmd</EM><STRONG>,</STRONG> [<EM>data</EM>]<STRONG>)</STRONG>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Fcntl()</STRONG>  performs  several  file  descriptor  related   functions,   like
     duplicating  a  file  descriptor,  setting the "close on exec" attribute,
     etc.  The <EM>fd</EM> argument is the file descriptor to operate on,  <EM>cmd</EM>  is  the
     command  code  of  the  operation  to  perform,  and  <EM>data</EM> is an optional
     argument to give or receive parameters.   The  command  codes  and  other
     symbols and types are declared in &lt;fcntl.h&gt;.  The commands are:

     <STRONG>fcntl(</STRONG><EM>fd</EM><STRONG>,</STRONG> <STRONG>F_DUPFD,</STRONG> <STRONG>int</STRONG> <EM>fd2</EM><STRONG>)</STRONG>
          Returns a new file descriptor that is a duplicate of file descriptor
          <EM>fd</EM>.  It shares the same file pointer and the same file status flags,
          but has separate file descriptor flags that are initially off.   The
          value  of  the  duplicate  file  descriptor  is  the first free file
          descriptor greater than or equal to <EM>fd2</EM>.

     <STRONG>fcntl(</STRONG><EM>fd</EM><STRONG>,</STRONG> <STRONG>F_GETFD)</STRONG>
          Returns the file descriptor flags associated  with  file  descriptor
          <EM>fd</EM>.   The  flags  are the "close on exec" flag <STRONG>FD_CLOEXEC</STRONG> that, when
          set, causes the file  descriptor  to  be  closed  when  the  process
          executes  another  program.  The Minix-vmd specific <STRONG>FD_ASYNCHIO</STRONG> flag
          marks a file descriptor for asynchronous I/O operation.

     <STRONG>fcntl(</STRONG><EM>fd</EM><STRONG>,</STRONG> <STRONG>F_SETFD,</STRONG> <STRONG>int</STRONG> <EM>flags</EM><STRONG>)</STRONG>
          Set the file descriptor flags of <EM>fd</EM> to <EM>flags</EM>.

     <STRONG>fcntl(</STRONG><EM>fd</EM><STRONG>,</STRONG> <STRONG>F_GETFL)</STRONG>
          Return the file status flags and file access modes  associated  with
          the  file associated with file descriptor <EM>fd</EM>.  The file status flags
          are <STRONG>O_NONBLOCK</STRONG> (non blocking I/O) and <STRONG>O_APPEND</STRONG> (append  mode).   The
          file  access  modes  are <STRONG>O_RDONLY</STRONG> (read-only), <STRONG>O_WRONLY</STRONG> (write-only)
          and <STRONG>O_RDWR</STRONG> (read-write).  These flags are also used  in  the  second
          argument of <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open(2)</A></STRONG>.

     <STRONG>fcntl(</STRONG><EM>fd</EM><STRONG>,</STRONG> <STRONG>F_SETFL,</STRONG> <STRONG>int</STRONG> <EM>flags</EM><STRONG>)</STRONG>
          Set the file status flags of the file referenced  by  <EM>fd</EM>  to  <EM>flags</EM>.
          Only  <STRONG>O_NONBLOCK</STRONG> and <STRONG>O_APPEND</STRONG> may be changed.  Access mode flags are
          ignored.

     The next four commands use a parameter  of  type  <STRONG>struct</STRONG>  <STRONG>flock</STRONG>  that  is
     defined in &lt;fcntl.h&gt; as:

          struct flock {
              short   l_type;     /* F_RDLCK, F_WRLCK, or F_UNLCK */
              short   l_whence;   /* SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, or SEEK_END */
              off_t   l_start;    /* byte offset to start of segment */
              off_t   l_len;      /* length of segment */
              pid_t   l_pid;      /* process id of the locks' owner */
          };

     This structure describes a  segment  of  a  file.   <STRONG>L_type</STRONG>  is  the  lock
     operation  performed  on  the  file segment:  <STRONG>F_RDLCK</STRONG> to set a read lock,
     <STRONG>F_WRLCK</STRONG> to set a write lock, and  <STRONG>F_UNLCK</STRONG>  to  remove  a  lock.   Several
     processes  may  have  a  read lock on a segment, but only one process can
     have a write  lock.   <STRONG>L_whence</STRONG>  tells  if  the  <STRONG>l_start</STRONG>  offset  must  be
     interpreted  from  the  start  of  the  file (<STRONG>SEEK_SET</STRONG>), the current file
     position (<STRONG>SEEK_CUR</STRONG>),  or  the  end  of  the  file  (<STRONG>SEEK_END</STRONG>).   This  is
     analogous  to  the third parameter of <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/lseek.2.html">lseek(2)</A></STRONG>.  These <STRONG>SEEK_*</STRONG> symbols are
     declared in &lt;unistd.h&gt;.  <STRONG>L_start</STRONG> is the starting offset of the segment of
     the  file.  <STRONG>L_end</STRONG> is the length of the segment.  If zero then the segment
     extends until end of file.   <STRONG>L_pid</STRONG>  is  the  process-id  of  the  process
     currently holding a lock on the segment.  It is returned by <STRONG>F_GETLK</STRONG>.

     <STRONG>fcntl(</STRONG><EM>fd</EM><STRONG>,</STRONG> <STRONG>F_GETLK,</STRONG> <STRONG>struct</STRONG> <STRONG>flock</STRONG> <STRONG>*</STRONG><EM>lkp</EM><STRONG>)</STRONG>
          Find out if some other process has a lock on a segment of  the  file
          associated  by  file  descriptor  <EM>fd</EM>  that overlaps with the segment
          described by the <STRONG>flock</STRONG> structure pointed to by <EM>lkp</EM>.  If the  segment
          is  not  locked  then  <STRONG>l_type</STRONG> is set to <STRONG>F_UNLCK</STRONG>.  Otherwise an <STRONG>flock</STRONG>
          structure is returned through <EM>lkp</EM> that describes the  lock  held  by
          the  other  process.   <STRONG>L_start</STRONG>  is  set relative to the start of the
          file.

     <STRONG>fcntl(</STRONG><EM>fd</EM><STRONG>,</STRONG> <STRONG>F_SETLK,</STRONG> <STRONG>struct</STRONG> <STRONG>flock</STRONG> <STRONG>*</STRONG><EM>lkp</EM><STRONG>)</STRONG>
          Register a lock on a  segment  of  the  file  associated  with  file
          descriptor  <EM>fd</EM>.   The  file segment is described by the <STRONG>struct</STRONG> <STRONG>flock</STRONG>
          pointed to by <EM>lkp</EM>.  This call returns an error if any  part  of  the
          segment is already locked.

     <STRONG>fcntl(</STRONG><EM>fd</EM><STRONG>,</STRONG> <STRONG>F_SETLKW,</STRONG> <STRONG>struct</STRONG> <STRONG>flock</STRONG> <STRONG>*</STRONG><EM>lkp</EM><STRONG>)</STRONG>
          Register a lock on a  segment  of  the  file  associated  with  file
          descriptor  <EM>fd</EM>.   The  file segment is described by the <STRONG>struct</STRONG> <STRONG>flock</STRONG>
          pointed to by <EM>lkp</EM>.  This call blocks waiting  for  the  lock  to  be
          released if any part of the segment is already locked.

     <STRONG>fcntl(</STRONG><EM>fd</EM><STRONG>,</STRONG> <STRONG>F_FREESP,</STRONG> <STRONG>struct</STRONG> <STRONG>flock</STRONG> <STRONG>*</STRONG><EM>lkp</EM><STRONG>)</STRONG>
          Free a segment of disk space occupied by the  file  associated  with
          file  descriptor  <EM>fd</EM>.   The segment is described by the <STRONG>struct</STRONG> <STRONG>flock</STRONG>
          pointed to by <EM>lkp</EM>.  The file is truncated  in  length  to  the  byte
          position indicated by <STRONG>l_start</STRONG> if <STRONG>l_len</STRONG> is zero.  If <STRONG>l_len</STRONG> is nonzero
          then the file keeps its size, but the freed bytes now read as zeros.
          (Other than sharing the flock structure, this call has nothing to do
          with locking.)

     <STRONG>fcntl(</STRONG><EM>fd</EM><STRONG>,</STRONG> <STRONG>F_SEEK,</STRONG> <STRONG>u64_t</STRONG> <EM>pos</EM><STRONG>)</STRONG>
          This Minix-vmd specific call sets the  file  position  of  the  file
          associated  with  file descriptor <EM>fd</EM> to the byte offset indicated by
          the 64-bit number <EM>pos</EM>.  This is analogous to the call

               <STRONG>lseek(</STRONG><EM>fd</EM><STRONG>,</STRONG> <EM>pos</EM><STRONG>,</STRONG> <STRONG>SEEK_SET)</STRONG>

          except that <STRONG>F_SEEK</STRONG> can be used on devices larger than 4 gigabyte.

<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Fcntl</STRONG> returns a file descriptor, flags, or <STRONG>0</STRONG>  to  indicate  success.   On
     error  <STRONG>-1</STRONG> is returned, with <STRONG>errno</STRONG> set to the appropriate error code.  The
     most notable errors are:

     <STRONG>EINTR</STRONG>
          If a blocked <STRONG>F_SETLKW</STRONG> operation is interrupted by a signal  that  is
          caught.

     <STRONG>EAGAIN</STRONG>
          By <STRONG>F_SETLK</STRONG> if a segment cannot be locked.

     <STRONG>EBADF</STRONG>
          A bad file descriptor in general, or an attempt  to  place  a  write
          lock on a file that is not open for writing, etc.

     <STRONG>ENOLCK</STRONG>
          No locks available, the file system code has  run  out  of  internal
          table space.
