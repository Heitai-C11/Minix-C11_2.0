     lseek - move read/write pointer

</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The descriptor <EM>d</EM> refers to a file  or  device  open  for  reading  and/or
     writing.  <STRONG>Lseek</STRONG> sets the file pointer of <EM>d</EM> as follows:

          If <EM>whence</EM> is SEEK_SET, the pointer is set to <EM>offset</EM> bytes.

          If <EM>whence</EM> is SEEK_CUR, the pointer is set to  its  current  location
          plus <EM>offset</EM>.

          If <EM>whence</EM> is SEEK_END, the pointer is set to the size  of  the  file
          plus <EM>offset</EM>.

     Upon successful completion, the resulting pointer location as measured in
     bytes from beginning of the file is returned.  Some devices are incapable
     of seeking.  The value of the pointer associated with such  a  device  is
     undefined.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
     Seeking far beyond the end of a file, then  writing,  creates  a  gap  or
     "hole", which occupies no physical space and reads as zeros.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
     Upon successful completion, the current file pointer value  is  returned.
     Otherwise,  a  value  of  -1 is returned and <STRONG>errno</STRONG> is set to indicate the
     error.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Lseek</STRONG> will fail and the file pointer will remain unchanged if:

     [EBADF]        <EM>Fildes</EM> is not an open file descriptor.

     [ESPIPE]       <EM>Fildes</EM> is associated with a pipe or a socket.

     [EINVAL]       <EM>Whence</EM> is not a proper value.

<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     This document's use of <EM>whence</EM> is incorrect English,  but  maintained  for
     historical reasons.
