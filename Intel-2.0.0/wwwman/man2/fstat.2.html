<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Stat</STRONG> obtains information about the file <EM>path</EM>.   Read,  write  or  execute
     permission  of the named file is not required, but all directories listed
     in the path name leading to the file must be reachable.

     <STRONG>Lstat</STRONG> is like <STRONG>stat</STRONG> except in the case where the named file is a  symbolic
     link,  in which case <STRONG>lstat</STRONG> returns information about the link, while <STRONG>stat</STRONG>
     returns information about the file the link references.  (Minix-vmd)

     <STRONG>Fstat</STRONG> obtains the same information about an open file referenced  by  the
     argument  descriptor,  such  as  would be obtained by an <STRONG>open</STRONG> call.  Pipe
     descriptors look like named pipes with a link count of zero.  The st_size
     field  of  pipes  or  named  pipes  shows  the  amount of bytes currently
     buffered in the pipe.

     <EM>Buf</EM> is a pointer to a <STRONG>stat</STRONG> structure into  which  information  is  placed
     concerning  the file.  The contents of the structure pointed to by <EM>buf</EM> is
     as follows:

     struct stat {
         dev_t     st_dev;     /* device inode resides on */
         ino_t     st_ino;     /* this inode's number */
         mode_t    st_mode;    /* file mode, protection bits, etc. */
         nlink_t   st_nlink;   /* number or hard links to the file */
         uid_t     st_uid;     /* user-id of the file's owner */
         gid_t     st_gid;     /* group-id of the file's owner */
         dev_t     st_rdev;    /* the device type, for inode that is device */
         off_t     st_size;    /* total size of file */
         time_t    st_atime;   /* time of last access */
         time_t    st_mtime;   /* time of last data modification */
         time_t    st_ctime;   /* time of last file status change */
     };

     st_atime    Time when file data was last read or  modified.   Changed  by
                 the following system calls:  <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/mknod.2.html">mknod(2)</A></STRONG>, <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/utime.2.html">utime(2)</A></STRONG>, <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</A></STRONG>, and
                 <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</A></STRONG>.  For reasons of efficiency,  st_atime  is  not  set
                 when  a  directory  is  searched, although this would be more
                 logical.

     st_mtime    Time when data was last modified.  It is not set  by  changes
                 of  owner,  group,  link  count,  or  mode.   Changed  by the
                 following system calls:  <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/mknod.2.html">mknod(2)</A></STRONG>, <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/utime.2.html">utime(2)</A></STRONG>, <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</A></STRONG>.

     st_ctime    Time when file status was last changed.  It is set both  both
                 by writing and changing the i-node.  Changed by the following
                 system  calls:    <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/chmod.2.html">chmod(2)</A></STRONG>   <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/chown.2.html">chown(2)</A></STRONG>,   <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/link.2.html">link(2)</A></STRONG>,   <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/mknod.2.html">mknod(2)</A></STRONG>,
                 <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/rename.2.html">rename(2)</A></STRONG>, <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/unlink.2.html">unlink(2)</A></STRONG>, <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/utime.2.html">utime(2)</A></STRONG>, <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</A></STRONG>.

     The file type information in <STRONG>st_mode</STRONG> has bits:

          #define S_IFMT     0170000    /* type of file */
          #define    S_IFIFO 0010000    /* named pipe */
          #define    S_IFCHR 0020000    /* character special */
          #define    S_IFDIR 0040000    /* directory */
          #define    S_IFBLK 0060000    /* block special */
          #define    S_IFREG 0100000    /* regular */
          #define    S_IFLNK 0120000    /* symbolic link (Minix-vmd) */

     The mode bits 0007777 encode set-uid/gid bits and  permission  bits  (see
     <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/chmod.2.html">chmod(2)</A></STRONG>).


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
     Upon successful completion a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a  value
     of -1 is returned and <STRONG>errno</STRONG> is set to indicate the error.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Stat</STRONG> and <STRONG>lstat</STRONG> will fail if one or more of the following are true:

     [ENOTDIR]      A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

     [ENAMETOOLONG] The path name exceeds PATH_MAX characters.

     [ENOENT]       The named file does not exist.

     [EACCES]       Search permission is denied for a component  of  the  path
                    prefix.

     [ELOOP]        Too many symbolic links were  encountered  in  translating
                    the pathname.  (Minix-vmd)

     [EFAULT]       <EM>Buf</EM> or <EM>name</EM> points to an invalid address.

     [EIO]          An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
                    file system.

     <STRONG>Fstat</STRONG> will fail if one or both of the following are true:



     [EBADF]        <EM>Fildes</EM> is not a valid open file descriptor.

     [EFAULT]       <EM>Buf</EM> points to an invalid address.

     [EIO]          An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
                    file system.
