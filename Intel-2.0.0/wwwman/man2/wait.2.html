</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Wait</STRONG> causes its caller to delay until a signal is received or one of  its
     child  processes  terminates.  If any child has died since the last <STRONG>wait</STRONG>,
     return is immediate, returning the process id and exit status of  one  of
     the  terminated  children.  If there are no children, return is immediate
     with the value -1 returned.

     On return from a successful <STRONG>wait</STRONG> call, <EM>status</EM> is nonzero,  and  the  high
     byte  of <EM>status</EM> contains the low byte of the argument to <STRONG>exit</STRONG> supplied by
     the child process; the low byte of <EM>status</EM> contains the termination status
     of the process.  A more precise definition of the <EM>status</EM> word is given in
     &lt;<EM>sys</EM>/<EM>wait</EM>.<EM>h</EM>&gt;.  If <STRONG>wait</STRONG>  can  called  with  a  null  pointer  argument  to
     indicate that no status need be returned.

     <STRONG>Waitpid</STRONG> provides an alternate interface for programs that must not  block
     when  collecting  the status of child processes, or that wish to wait for
     one particular child.  The pid parameter is the process ID of  the  child
     to wait for, -1 for any child.  The <EM>status</EM> parameter is defined as above.
     The <EM>options</EM> parameter is used to indicate the call should  not  block  if
     there  are no processes that wish to report status (WNOHANG), and/or that
     children of the current process  that  are  stopped  due  to  a  SIGTTIN,
     SIGTTOU,  SIGTSTP,  or  SIGSTOP  signal  should  also  have  their status
     reported (WUNTRACED).  (Job control is not  implemented  for  Minix,  but
     these symbold and signals are.)

     When the WNOHANG option is specified and  no  processes  wish  to  report
     status,  <STRONG>waitpid</STRONG>  returns  -1  with <STRONG>errno</STRONG> set to <STRONG>EAGAIN</STRONG>.  The WNOHANG and
     WUNTRACED options may be combined by <EM>or</EM>'ing the two values.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
     The call <STRONG>wait(&amp;</STRONG><EM>status</EM><STRONG>)</STRONG> is equivalent to <STRONG>waitpid(-1,</STRONG> <STRONG>&amp;</STRONG><EM>status</EM><STRONG>,</STRONG> <STRONG>0)</STRONG>.

     See <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/sigaction.2.html">sigaction(2)</A></STRONG> for a list of termination statuses (signals);  0  status
     indicates  normal termination.  A special status (0177) is returned for a
     stopped process that  has  not  terminated  and  can  be  restarted;  see
     <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/ptrace.2.html">ptrace(2)</A></STRONG>.   If  the  0200  bit  of the termination status is set, a core
     image of the process was produced by the system.



     If the parent process terminates without waiting  on  its  children,  the
     initialization process (process ID = 1) inherits the children.

     &lt;<EM>sys</EM>/<EM>wait</EM>.<EM>h</EM>&gt; defines a number of macros that operate on a status word:

     <STRONG>WIFEXITED(</STRONG><EM>status</EM><STRONG>)</STRONG>
          True if normal exit.

     <STRONG>WEXITSTATUS(</STRONG><EM>status</EM><STRONG>)</STRONG>
          Exit  status  if  the  process  returned  by  a  normal  exit,  zero
          otherwise.

     <STRONG>WTERMSIG(</STRONG><EM>status</EM><STRONG>)</STRONG>
          Signal number if the process died by a signal, zero otherwise.

     <STRONG>WIFSIGNALED(</STRONG><EM>status</EM><STRONG>)</STRONG>
          True if the process died by a signal.

     <STRONG>WIFSTOPPED(</STRONG><EM>status</EM><STRONG>)</STRONG>
          True if the process is stopped.  (Never true under Minix.)

     <STRONG>WSTOPSIG(</STRONG><EM>status</EM><STRONG>)</STRONG>
          Signal number of the signal that stopped the process.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
     If <STRONG>wait</STRONG> returns due to a stopped or terminated child process, the process
     ID  of  the child is returned to the calling process.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and <STRONG>errno</STRONG> is set to indicate the error.

     <STRONG>Waitpid</STRONG> returns -1 if there are no children not previously waited for, if
     the  process  that  it  wants to wait for doesn't exist, or if WNOHANG is
     specified and there are no stopped or exited children.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Wait</STRONG> will fail and return immediately if one or more of the following are
     true:

     [ECHILD]       The calling process has  no  existing  unwaited-for  child
                    processes.

     [EFAULT]       The <EM>status</EM> argument points to an illegal address.

     [EAGAIN]       <STRONG>Waitpid</STRONG> is called with the WNOHANG option and no child has
                    exited yet.
