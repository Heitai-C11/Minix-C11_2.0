     utime - set file times


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</STRONG>
     <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;utime.h&gt;</STRONG>

     <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>utime(const</STRONG> <STRONG>char</STRONG> <STRONG>*</STRONG><EM>file</EM><STRONG>,</STRONG> <STRONG>struct</STRONG> <STRONG>utimbuf</STRONG> <STRONG>*</STRONG><EM>times</EM><STRONG>)</STRONG>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The <STRONG>utime</STRONG> call uses the "accessed" and "updated" times from  the  utimbuf
     structure pointed to by <EM>times</EM> to set the corresponding recorded times for
     <EM>file</EM>.

     Struct utimbuf is defined in &lt;utime.h&gt; as follows:

          struct utimbuf {
              time_t    actime;     /* access time */
              time_t    modtime;    /* modification time */
          };

     The caller must be the owner of the file or the super-user.  The  "inode-
     changed" time of the file is set to the current time.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and <STRONG>errno</STRONG> is set to indicate the error.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Utime</STRONG> will fail if one or more of the following are true:

     [ENOTDIR]      A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

     [EINVAL]       The pathname contains a character with the high-order  bit
                    set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG] The path name exceeds PATH_MAX characters.

     [ENOENT]       The named file does not exist.

     [ELOOP]        Too many symbolic links were  encountered  in  translating
                    the pathname.  (Minix-vmd)

     [EPERM]        The process is not super-user and not  the  owner  of  the
                    file.

     [EACCES]       Search permission is denied for a component  of  the  path
                    prefix.


     [EROFS]        The file system containing the file is mounted read-only.

     [EFAULT]       <EM>File</EM> or  <EM>times</EM>  points  outside  the  process's  allocated
                    address space.

     [EIO]          An  I/O  error  occurred  while  reading  or  writing  the
                    affected inode.
