<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     chroot - change root directory


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</STRONG>

     <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>chroot(const</STRONG> <STRONG>char</STRONG> <STRONG>*</STRONG><EM>dirname</EM><STRONG>)</STRONG>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <EM>Dirname</EM> is the address of the pathname of a directory,  terminated  by  a
     null  byte.   <STRONG>Chroot</STRONG>  causes this directory to become the root directory,
     the starting point for path names beginning with ``/''.

     In order for a directory to become the root directory a process must have
     execute (search) access to the directory.

     This call is restricted to the super-user.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and <STRONG>errno</STRONG> is set to indicate an error.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Chroot</STRONG> will fail and the root directory will be unchanged if one or  more
     of the following are true:

     [ENOTDIR]      A component of the path name is not a directory.

     [ENAMETOOLONG] The path name exceeds PATH_MAX characters.

     [ENOENT]       The named directory does not exist.

     [EACCES]       Search permission is denied for any component of the  path
                    name.

     [ELOOP]        Too many symbolic links were  encountered  in  translating
                    the pathname.  (Minix-vmd)

     [EFAULT]       <EM>Path</EM> points outside the process's allocated address space.

     [EIO]          An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
                    file system.
