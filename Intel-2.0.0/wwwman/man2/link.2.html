     link - make a hard link to a file


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</STRONG>

     <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>link(const</STRONG> <STRONG>char</STRONG> <STRONG>*</STRONG><EM>name1</EM><STRONG>,</STRONG> <STRONG>const</STRONG> <STRONG>char</STRONG> <STRONG>*</STRONG><EM>name2</EM><STRONG>)</STRONG>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     A hard link to <EM>name1</EM> is created; the link has the name <EM>name2</EM>.  <EM>Name1</EM> must
     exist.

     With hard links, both <EM>name1</EM> and <EM>name2</EM> must be in the  same  file  system.
     <EM>Name1</EM> must not be a directory.  Both the old and the new <EM>link</EM> share equal
     access and rights to the underlying object.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and <STRONG>errno</STRONG> is set to indicate the error.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Link</STRONG> will fail and no link  will  be  created  if  one  or  more  of  the
     following are true:

     [ENOTDIR]      A component of either path prefix is not a directory.

     [ENAMETOOLONG] A path name exceeds PATH_MAX characters.

     [ENOENT]       A component of either path prefix does not exist.

     [EACCES]       A  component  of  either   path   prefix   denies   search
                    permission.

     [EACCES]       The requested link requires writing in a directory with  a
                    mode that denies write permission.

     [ELOOP]        Too many symbolic links were  encountered  in  translating
                    one of the pathnames.  (Minix-vmd)

     [ENOENT]       The file named by <EM>name1</EM> does not exist.

     [EEXIST]       The link named by <EM>name2</EM> does exist.

     [EPERM]        The file named by <EM>name1</EM> is a directory and  the  effective
                    user ID is not super-user.

     [EXDEV]        The link named by <EM>name2</EM> and the file named by <EM>name1</EM> are on
                    different file systems.


     [ENOSPC]       The directory in which the entry for the new link is being
                    placed  cannot  be extended because there is no space left
                    on the file system containing the directory.

     [EIO]          An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
                    file system to make the directory entry.

     [EROFS]        The requested link requires writing in a  directory  on  a
                    read-only file system.

     [EFAULT]       One of the pathnames specified is  outside  the  process's
                    allocated address space.
