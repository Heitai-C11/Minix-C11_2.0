<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     close - delete a descriptor


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</STRONG>

     <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>close(int</STRONG> <EM>d</EM><STRONG>)</STRONG>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The <STRONG>close</STRONG> call deletes a descriptor from the per-process object reference
     table.   If  this is the last reference to the underlying object, then it
     will be deactivated.  For example, on  the  last  close  of  a  file  the
     current  <EM>seek</EM> pointer associated with the file is lost; on the last close
     of a TCP/IP descriptor associated naming information and queued data  are
     discarded;  on the last close of a file holding an advisory lock the lock
     is released (see further <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</A></STRONG>).

     A close of all of a process's descriptors is automatic on <EM>exit</EM>, but since
     there  is  a limit on the number of active descriptors per process, <STRONG>close</STRONG>
     is necessary for programs that deal with many descriptors.

     When a process forks (see <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</A></STRONG>), all descriptors  for  the  new  child
     process  reference  the same objects as they did in the parent before the
     fork.  If a new process is then to be run using  <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</A></STRONG>,  the  process
     would normally inherit these descriptors.  Most of the descriptors can be
     rearranged with <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/dup2.2.html">dup2(2)</A></STRONG> or  deleted  with  <STRONG>close</STRONG>  before  the  <STRONG>execve</STRONG>  is
     attempted,  but  if some of these descriptors will still be needed if the
     <STRONG>execve</STRONG> fails, it is necessary to arrange for them to  be  closed  if  the
     <STRONG>execve</STRONG>  succeeds.  For this reason, the call ``fcntl(d, F_SETFD, <EM>flags</EM>)''
     is provided, that can be used to mark a descriptor  "close  on  exec"  by
     setting the <STRONG>FD_CLOEXEC</STRONG> flag:

          fcntl(d, F_SETFD, fcntl(d, F_GETFD) | FD_CLOEXEC);


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of  -1  is  returned  and  the  global  integer  variable <STRONG>errno</STRONG> is set to
     indicate the error.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Close</STRONG> will fail if:

     [EBADF]        <EM>D</EM> is not an active descriptor.
