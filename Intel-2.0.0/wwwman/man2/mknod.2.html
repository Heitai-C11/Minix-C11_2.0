</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Mknod</STRONG> creates a new file whose name is <EM>path</EM>. The mode  of  the  new  file
     (including  special  file  bits)  is initialized from <EM>mode</EM>, as defined in
     &lt;<EM>sys</EM>/<EM>stat</EM>.<EM>h</EM>&gt;.  (The protection part  of  the  mode  is  modified  by  the
     process's  mode  mask (see <STRONG><A HREF="../man2/umask.2.html">umask(2)</A></STRONG>)).  The first block pointer of the i-
     node is initialized from <EM>dev</EM> and is used  to  specify  which  device  the
     special file refers to.

     If mode indicates a block or character special file, <EM>dev</EM>  is  the  device
     number  of  a  character  or block I/O device.  The low eight bits of the
     device number hold the minor device number that selects  a  device  among
     the  devices  governed by the same driver.  The driver is selected by the
     major device number, the next eight bits of the device number.

     If <EM>mode</EM> does not indicate a block special or  character  special  device,
     <EM>dev</EM> is ignored.  (For example, when creating a ``fifo'' special file.)

     <STRONG>Mknod</STRONG> may be invoked only by the super-user, unless it is being  used  to
     create a fifo.

     The call <STRONG>mkfifo(</STRONG><EM>path</EM><STRONG>,</STRONG> <EM>mode</EM><STRONG>)</STRONG> is equivalent to

          <STRONG>mknod(</STRONG><EM>path</EM><STRONG>,</STRONG> <STRONG>(</STRONG><EM>mode</EM> <STRONG>&amp;</STRONG> <STRONG>0777)</STRONG> <STRONG>|</STRONG> <STRONG>S_IFIFO,</STRONG> <STRONG>0)</STRONG>


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
     Upon successful completion a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a  value
     of -1 is returned and <STRONG>errno</STRONG> is set to indicate the error.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Mknod</STRONG> will fail and the file mode will be unchanged if:

     [ENOTDIR]      A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

     [ENAMETOOLONG] The path name exceeds PATH_MAX characters.

     [ENOENT]       A component of the path prefix does not exist.



     [EACCES]       Search permission is denied for a component  of  the  path
                    prefix.

     [ELOOP]        Too many symbolic links were  encountered  in  translating
                    the pathname.  (Minix-vmd)

     [EPERM]        The process's effective user ID is not super-user.

     [EIO]          An I/O error occurred while making the directory entry  or
                    allocating the inode.

     [ENOSPC]       The directory in which the entry for the new node is being
                    placed  cannot  be extended because there is no space left
                    on the file system containing the directory.

     [ENOSPC]       There are no free inodes on the file system on  which  the
                    node is being created.

     [EROFS]        The named file resides on a read-only file system.

     [EEXIST]       The named file exists.

     [EFAULT]       <EM>Path</EM> points outside the process's allocated address space.
