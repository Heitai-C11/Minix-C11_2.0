<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>Mount()</STRONG> tells the system that the file system <EM>special</EM> is to be mounted on
     the file <EM>name</EM>, effectively overlaying <EM>name</EM> with the file tree on <EM>special</EM>.
     <EM>Name</EM> may of any type, except that if the root of <EM>special</EM> is a  directory,
     then  <EM>name</EM>  must  also  be  a directory.  <EM>Special</EM> must be a block special
     file, except for loopback mounts.  For loopback mounts a normal  file  or
     directory  is  used  for  <EM>special</EM>,  which  must  be seen as the root of a
     virtual device.  <EM>Flag</EM> is 0 for a read-write mount, 1 for read-only.

     <STRONG>Umount()</STRONG> removes the connection between a device and a mount point,  <EM>name</EM>
     may  refer  to either of them.  If more than one device is mounted on the
     same mount point then unmounting at the  mount  point  removes  the  last
     mounted  device,  unmounting a device removes precisely that device.  The
     unmount will only succeed if none of the files on the device are in use.

     Both calls may only be executed by the super-user.
