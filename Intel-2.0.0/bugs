List of bugs discovered in 2.0.0.  Please report more bugs to kjb@cs.vu.nl.

1  The code handling the resetting of an Adaptec does not work on some
   adapters, notably the old 1540A type.  A fix to this bug can be found
   in fixes/fix-1.

2  A huge "ping" packet crashes the TCP/IP server.  (The so-called "Ping
   of Death".)  For 32-bit Minix this problem can be circumvented by
   increasing the number of input buffers.  See fixes/fix-2.

3  The isoread command contains a bug in the name matching code.
   Repaired by fixes/fix-3.

4  The make command contains an insidious bug that plagues people with
   fast machines.  (Where "fast" is defined as "better than a 486/66".)
   A patch can be found in fixes/fix-4.  As a bonus this fix also adds an
   "include some-file" statement to the makefile syntax.

5  The Mitsumi CD-ROM driver interprets the "MCD" boot variable wrong.
   Use fixes/fix-5 to repair.
