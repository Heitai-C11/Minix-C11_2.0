ACK Modula-2 and Pascal compilers for Minix 2.0.0

This directory contains the binaries and library sources for the ACK
Modula-2 and Pascal compilers that can be added to Minix 2.0.0.
(And to Minix 1.7.2 and inbetween versions, although that has not
been tested well.) 

Minix already has a C compiler derived from the Amsterdam Compiler
Kit, but thanks to a misunderstanding the Modula-2 and Pascal
compilers were not added to the distribution. The next distribution of
Minix will have them by default. 

Two packages are available for the 16 and 32-bit versions of Minix: 

        ack_i86.taz     - 16-bit version.
        ack_i386.taz    - 32-bit version.

Installation

To install use FDVOL to place the proper file on a floppy, and run 
setup /usr under Minix to load the files onto your system. The
binaries of the new compiler passes will be installed, several
Makefiles replaced, and library sources for the Modula-2 and Pascal
compilers added. (The 32-bit version also contains all other compiler
passes to make sure that you have the latest binaries in case you
source-upgraded all the way up from 1.7.0.) 

Compilation

Log in as bin. If your system runs in 16-bit mode then run make
install in src/commands/i86/ to recompile the 16-bit compiler driver. 

On either kind of system, run make install in src/lib/ to compile the
Modula-2 and Pascal additions to the library. The compilers are now
ready for use. 

Manual pages.

The manual page cc(1) will be renewed. It now focuses on the 32-bit
driver, with differences with the 16-bit compiler noted where
necessary. A new manual page ACK(7) is added that contains a large
amount of additional information on the ACK compilers. Use 
makewhatis /usr/man to allow the man command to find it.
