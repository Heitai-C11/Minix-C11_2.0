<h2>ACK Modula-2 and Pascal compilers for Minix 2.0.0</h2>

This directory contains the binaries and library sources for the ACK
Modula-2 and Pascal compilers that can be added to Minix 2.0.0.  (And to
Minix 1.7.2 and inbetween versions, although that has not been tested
well.)
<p>
Minix already has a C compiler derived from the Amsterdam Compiler Kit,
but thanks to a misunderstanding the Modula-2 and Pascal compilers were
not added to the distribution.  The next distribution of Minix will have
them by default.
<p>
Two packages are available for the 16 and 32-bit versions of Minix:

<pre>
	<a href="ack_i86.taz">ack_i86.taz</a>	- 16-bit version.
	<a href="ack_i386.taz">ack_i386.taz</a>	- 32-bit version.
</pre>

<h3>Installation</h3>
To install use <b>FDVOL</b> to place the proper file on a floppy, and
run <b>setup /usr</b> under Minix to load the files onto your system.
The binaries of the new compiler passes will be installed, several
Makefiles replaced, and library sources for the Modula-2 and Pascal
compilers added.
(The 32-bit version also contains all other compiler passes to make
sure that you have the latest binaries in case you source-upgraded all
the way up from 1.7.0.)

<h3>Compilation</h3>
Log in as <b>bin</b>.  If your system runs in 16-bit mode then run
<b>make install</b> in <b>src/commands/i86/</b> to recompile the 16-bit
compiler driver.
<p>
On either kind of system, run <b>make install</b> in <b>src/lib/</b> to 
compile the Modula-2 and Pascal additions to the library.  The compilers
are now ready for use.

<h3>Manual pages.</h3>
The manual page <b>cc</b>(1) will be renewed.  It now focuses on the
32-bit driver, with differences with the 16-bit compiler noted where
appropriate.  A new manual page <b>ACK</b>(7) is added that contains a
large amount of additional information on the ACK compilers.  Use
<b>makewhatis /usr/man</b> to allow the <b>man</b> command to find it.
